<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</a></h2>


<p>This Handbook contains, in a form convenient for everyday use, a number
of articles on Rustic Carpentry contributed by various authors to <span
class="smcap">Work</span>&mdash;one of the journals it is my fortune to edit.</p>

<p>Readers who may desire additional information respecting special details
of the matters dealt with in this Handbook, or instructions on kindred
subjects, should address a question to the Editor of <span class="smcap">Work</span>, La Belle
Sauvage, London, EC., so that it may be answered in the columns of that
journal.</p>

<h3>LIGHT RUSTIC WORK.</h3>


<p>Rustic carpentry does not demand great skill in
woodworking, but it does require a large amount
of artistic perception. The tools needed are but
few, and the materials employed are comparatively
cheap, although in many districts they are
becoming dearer every year.</p>

<p>It may be said that any articles made from
the now popular bamboo may be made quite as
effectively in light rustic work.</p>

<p>For light rustic work, sticks of hazel, cherry,
yew, blackthorn, birch, larch, fir, and the prunings
of many varieties of shrubs may be used;
but it is necessary that the material should be cut
at the proper season, and thoroughly dried before
being worked up. The sticks should be cut in
mid-winter, as at that time the sap is at rest;
if cut in the summer time the bark will peel off.
If peeled sticks are required, they should be cut
in the spring, when the sap is rising, as at that
time the rind will come off easily. In some districts
the copses are cleared of undergrowth
periodically, and the sticks (generally hazel) sold
to hurdle and spar makers. A selection of these
sticks would be very suitable for the purpose here
described.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>The sticks should be stacked in an open shed
in an upright position if possible, and in such a
manner that the air can freely circulate around
them. When they are required for fishing rods
or walking sticks they are hung up to season&mdash;this
keeps them straighter; but the hanging of
them up is not necessary for the work about to be
dealt with. When the sticks have been put away
for from six to twelve months, according to size,
they will be ready for use, after being rubbed
with a cloth or brushed to clean off the dust and
bring up the colour of the bark. Fir cones may
often be worked into a design, and bits of rough
bark and the warts and burrs found on old
elm trees may be collected by the rustic worker
and put by for future use.</p>

  <br />
  </span>
</div>
<div class="pmb1"></div>

<p>One method of treatment for designs in light
rustic work is to split the sticks and use them
to overlay the work with a Swiss pattern, as
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
shown by <a href="#Fig_1">Fig. 1</a>; another method is to work the
sticks up after the manner that canes are used
in bamboo furniture (see <a href="#Fig_3">Figs. 3</a> and <a href="#Fig_42">Fig. 42</a>, pp. 12
and 36).</p>

<div class="pmb1"></div>

<p><a href="#Fig_1">Fig. 1</a> represents a wall bracket with a photograph
or mirror in the frame. To make this, the
piece forming the back is first cut out of <sup><span style="font-size:.7em">3</span></sup>/<span style="font-size:.7em">8</span>-in.
deal. The shelf, of &frac34;-in. deal, is then nailed to
the bottom edge. Some straight hazel, fir, or
other sticks are next selected and split; these are
nailed round the edges of the back, and round
the opening at the centre. The pieces round the
opening overlap the edges about &frac14; in., to form a
rebate for the glass. The bare spaces at the sides
and top may be covered in the following manner:
Take a piece of brown elm bark and run a saw
into it. Catch the sawdust, and, after warming
the wood, cover it with thin glue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

  Fig. 3.&mdash;Small Easel in Rustic Work.</span><br />
  <br />
  </span>
</div>
<div class="pmb1"></div>

<p>Sprinkle the
brown sawdust on the glued surface, and sufficient
will adhere to cover the deal and give the
frame a rustic appearance. Cork-dust or filings
may be used instead of sawdust. Bunches of fir
or larch cones are nailed to the corners, as illustrated;
these should be pared at the back with
knife or chisel to a flat surface. The outer edge
of the shelf is finished with an edging of short
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
lengths of split stick nailed on. The general
construction of the bracket, and the method of
fixing the glass, will be clear from <a href="#Fig_2">Fig. 2</a>, which
is a section through the centre.</p>

<p>A small easel for photographs, or, if constructed
larger, for a fire-screen, is shown by
<a href="#Fig_3">Fig. 3</a>. It is made entirely of round sticks.
<a href="#Fig_4">Fig. 4</a> illustrates the method of attaching the
back support&mdash;namely, by means of a couple of
staples, which may be made out of a hairpin.
In jointing round sticks together, the joints may
be mitred by notching a <b>V</b>-shaped piece out of
one stick and cutting the other to fit (<a href="#Fig_5">Fig. 5</a>);
or a mortise and tenon, as represented by <a href="#Fig_6">Fig. 6</a>,
may be used.</p>

<p>In making the easel (<a href="#Fig_3">Fig. 3</a>), the top and
bottom bars are mitred to the sides, and the
central upright to the top and bottom bars. The
joints are secured by either brads or panel pins.
Care must be taken to bore for the nails with a
bradawl, as nothing looks worse than splits in
the work. The upright piece in the centre of the
top bar may be secured by driving a long panel
pin into the lower upright through the top bar,
filing the head to a point to form a dowel, and
driving the top piece on with a hammer.</p>

<p>Where a small stick is joined to a larger one, as in the
case of the filling-in pieces, a flat may be made
with a knife or chisel on the larger stick, and the
smaller one cut to fit and nailed on. In making a
small easel, only a single stick attached to the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
centre upright will be required to form a back
support, but for a larger one it will be preferable
to frame it as shown by <a href="#Fig_3">Fig. 3</a>.</p>

    </div>

<p>The finished articles may be either stained and
varnished or left plain. Cherry sticks look well
if the bark is left the natural colour, and the
ends, where exposed, cleaned off and varnished
without being stained. Some sticks improve in
colour if rubbed over with a rag moistened with
linseed oil.</p>

<p>If a stain is required, one that is sold in
bottles would be suitable, but a little vandyke
brown, ground in water, and applied with a
sponge, answers the purpose. Sometimes, as in
the case of the table top (see <a href="#Fig_42">Fig. 42</a>, p. 36), it is
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
a good plan to stain the wood before nailing on
the pattern work, or there will be danger, if the
sticks are dark in colour, of the lighter wood
showing through.</p>

<p>If the rustic work is intended to be placed
out of doors, it should be given two or three
coats of hard outside varnish.</p>

<p>The rustic flower-holder for table decoration,
shown by <a href="#Fig_7">Fig. 7</a>, consists simply of a gipsy tripod
formed with six rustic sticks, put together in the
form shown, and tied with a length of bass.
There is no attempt made at finish, but the sticks
must be firmly tied together at the joints, and
the ends of the bass can be left, either hanging
loose or tied in a bow. The holder for the flowers
is a cocoanut shell, which has been sawn in two,
so as to leave one part a sort of cup or egg
shape; three holes are bored with a bradawl at
equal distances round the edge, and it is suspended
from the tripod with three more pieces of
the bass, which completes the arrangement. Of
course, any small receptacle can be used in place
of the cocoanut shell, but that, perhaps, carries
out the rustic appearance the best, and is very
easily obtained. <a href="#Fig_8">Fig. 8</a> is an attempt to show the
tripod when decorated.</p>

<p>The rustic hall-stand shown by Figs. 9 to 11
was made actually from branches and twigs of an
old apple tree. The uprights and principal cross-pieces
are <sup><span style="font-size:.7em">7</span></sup>/<span style="font-size:.7em">8</span> in. thick, and the criss-cross pieces
are &frac12; in. thick. The bottom is made of four pieces
1&frac12; in. thick. The longer ones measure 1 ft. 8 in.,
and the shorter ones 1 ft. 2 in.; they are nailed
together in such a manner that the ends at the
two front corners each cross and project 2&frac12; in.
The front uprights are 2 ft. high, the back ones
2 ft. 2 in.; the longer cross-pieces are 1 ft. 8 in.,
the shorter 11 in. The ends intersect and project
3 in. at each of the front corners; only the longest
piece projects 3 in. at the back corners, the
shorter pieces being cut off flush with the frame
to allow of the stand fitting close to a wall.</p>

<p>These
cross-pieces are nailed to the uprights to allow
the top ends of the latter to project 2 in. above
them, this bringing the measurement of the oblong
inner framework to 1 ft. 10 in. by 1 ft. 2 in.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
The thin pieces are nailed on as shown in <a href="#Fig_9">Fig. 9</a>,
being interlaced as much as possible. The back of
the stand is treated in a similar manner. The
whole of the wood is used as rough as possible,
the bark being retained, with the knots, etc.; the
ends are, however, pared off smooth with a chisel.
Two coats of varnish finish the stand, save for the
addition of a receptacle to catch the drainings
from umbrellas, and for this the stand illustrated
has a painted baking-tin <span class="smcap">A</span> (<a href="#Fig_11">Fig. 11</a>).</p>

<p>The rustic stool (<a href="#Fig_12">Figs. 12</a> and <a href="#Fig_13">13</a>) is intended
to be made in pairs, and placed one on each side
of the umbrella-stand above described, each supporting
a plant, such as a fern or palm. The
top of each stool is cut from 9 in. square 1-in.
wood (wood from an old box answers well), and
is sawn into an octagonal shape. A double row
of pieces of apple, maple, or some other wood
with good bark, is nailed around the edges,
thicker pieces being used at the bottom than at
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
the top to give a graduated appearance. The
entire top is then covered with straight pieces of
stick, selected for the beauty of their bark. All
pieces are nailed on with cut brads. The four
legs are formed of 1-in. apple-wood 9 in. long.
They are bevelled at the top to fit a square block
of wood, 2 in. thick and 3 in. long, which is firmly
secured to the top by two screws. This piece of
wood should be fastened to the top before the
rustic rods are placed in position. Two 2&frac12;-in.
wire nails through each of the legs hold them
quite securely to the central block. Portions of
rustic wood, from &frac14; in. to <sup><span style="font-size:.7em">3</span></sup>/<span style="font-size:.7em">8</span> in. in diameter, are
then nailed across the legs, as shown in <a href="#Fig_12">Fig. 12</a>, the
ends being allowed to cross each other and project
about 1 in. all ways. The whole stool, when
finished, stands 10&frac12; in. high, and is so strong that
it will support a heavy man with safety. The
block of wood to which the legs are attached
should be stained to match the rustic wood;
permanganate of potash solution will effect this.
Finally, two coats of clear varnish give a good
finish to the work.</p>

<a href="#Fig_16">16</a>. That shown by <a href="#Fig_14">Fig. 14</a> is made from a raisin
box obtained from a grocer. Such boxes are not
costly, and to buy and knock these up for rough
uses is often more economical than buying new
material.</p>

<p>Take care that the boards are stout
enough to hold the brads firmly. The box measures
about 21 in. by 7 in. by 7 in., and is wholly
covered with mosaic of dark and light strips in
panels. Strips are also nailed on the upper
edges.</p>

<p>The more elaborate window box (<a href="#Fig_15">Figs. 15</a> and
<a href="#Fig_16">16</a>) can be made of a size to fit the window for
which it is intended. A few holes should be bored in
the bottom for drainage, and the front board is
cut to the shape shown and the rustic ornament
is nailed to the box and forms no part of the construction.
In <a href="#Fig_16">Fig. 16</a> wedge pieces are shown
fitted to the stone sill to bring the box level; it
is kept in position by two metal angle-pieces
screwed both to the wood sill and to the back of
the box.</p>

<h3>FLOWER STANDS, VASES, ETC.</h3>


<p>The rustic-work flower stand (<a href="#Fig_17">Fig. 17</a>) may be
3 ft. high by 3 ft. 6 in. long by 9 in. wide. For
the legs, select four curved saplings 3 ft. 3 in. long
by 2&frac12; in. in diameter; and as some difficulty may
be experienced in obtaining them with the natural
curves sufficiently alike, artificial methods of
bending must be resorted to. Therefore get the
saplings from 2 ft. to 3 ft. longer than the finished
length, and bend them to shape by means of the
Spanish windlass as shown in <a href="#Fig_18">Fig. 18</a>. Flexible
six-strand fixing wire or stout hemp cord can be
used; or a straining screw and link, as employed
for tightening fencing wire, will answer
equally well; keep the tension on till the wood is
curved permanently, the time varying with the
nature and condition of the wood, and the strain
being applied gradually at intervals. The rails
are tenoned to fit mortises in the legs, and battens
are nailed to the lower long rails, to support the
flower pots (see <a href="#Fig_19">Fig. 19</a>). The rustic work is then
fixed diagonally to the rails. The ends that abut
against the legs and centre-piece are pared away
so as to make a neat joint, and angle boards are
fitted to the under side of the lower rails to
support the rustic work where it curves downwards.</p>

<p>The vase shown by <a href="#Fig_20">Fig. 20</a> is hexagonal in
shape, with vandyked sides fixed to a base supported
upon tripod legs, and stands about 3 ft.
3 in. high. Elm boards are suitable for the
sides and bottom; they are 1 ft. 3 in. high by
9 in. wide at the top end, and 6&frac12; in. wide at the
bottom by 1 in. thick. Shoot the edges of the
boards to a bevel of 60°, and fix them with nails
driven as shown at <a href="#Fig_21">Fig. 21</a>. When the six sides
are completed, prepare the hexagon baseboard to
suit. Bore holes in it for drainage, and also bore
three equidistant holes, 1&frac14; in. in diameter, at an
angle of about 60°, for the tenons of the legs to
enter (see <a href="#Fig_22">Fig. 22</a>). Next screw the base to the
sides, and fix on the barked rustic work. The
twigs for this should be seasoned at least one
year before using. They are sawn in halves,
straight twigs being selected for the purpose. If
necessary, shoot the edges slightly, so as to obtain
a closer fit when fixing them in parallel. Begin by
attaching the lower border to the hexagonal base,
then the upright pieces over the angles, hollowed
as shown at <a href="#Fig_23">Fig. 23</a>; next fix the top sloping
pieces, and finally the horizontal twigs. The legs
are nailed at the base of the vase (see <a href="#Fig_22">Fig. 22</a>);
and at the centre, where they cross, they are
further secured with twigs, which do the duty of
rungs, as shown in <a href="#Fig_20">Fig. 20</a>.</p>

<p>The flower stand shown in front and end view
by <a href="#Fig_24">Figs. 24</a> and <a href="#Fig_25">25</a> has accommodation for sixteen
pots. The two uprights are 2 ft. 8 in. high by
about 2&frac12; in. in diameter. The three rails are
2 ft. 9 in. long, and are tenoned to the posts as
shown by <a href="#Fig_26">Fig. 26</a>; the posts are also tenoned and
nailed to the sills (bottom rails), and strutted, as
shown in <a href="#Fig_25">Fig. 25</a>. The method of fixing the
shelves <span class="smcap">A</span> and <span class="smcap">B</span> (<a href="#Fig_24">Fig. 24</a>) is shown in <a href="#Fig_27">Fig. 27</a>,
which is an under-side view; struts are also fitted,
as shown in <a href="#Fig_25">Fig. 25</a>. The method of fixing the
centre shelves is indicated at <a href="#Fig_28">Fig. 28</a>. The shelf,
and also the struts <span class="smcap">C</span>, <span class="smcap">D</span>, <span class="smcap">E</span>, and <span class="smcap">E</span><sup>1</sup> (<a href="#Fig_24">Figs. 24</a> and
<a href="#Fig_25">25</a>), are fixed to the centre rail; then the top
diagonal braces are nailed to both the shelf and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
the top rail, thus keeping the whole secure. The
remainder of the work calls for no special instructions.
Split twigs are used for the fencing
around the shelves.</p>

will be 1 ft. 8 in. at the top and 1 ft. 5 in. at

for drainage. The short feet having been secured
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
with screws driven from the inside, the split
rustic work is bradded on in the same order as
that described for <a href="#Fig_20">Fig. 20</a>.</p>

<p>The stands and vases should be given two
coats of oil varnish, allowing the first coat to
dry before applying the second.</p>

<p>A big plant vase made from half a paraffin
cask is illustrated by <a href="#Fig_31">Fig. 31</a>. An ordinary
40-gal. cask stands, roughly, some 3 ft. high, has
a diameter of some 2 ft., and is made of good
stout oak. Sawn through the middle, the paraffin
barrel makes two admirable tubs. One such
half is shown in <a href="#Fig_31">Fig. 31</a>. This it is proposed to
render suitable for some large bushy plant, so it
will have to be mounted on legs. The legs shown
are simply so many pieces cut from rough
branches. From a heap of stuff one can generally
choose pieces sufficiently adapted to the purpose,
though their exact contours will, of course, vary.
Oak branches, technically known as "bangles,"
from which the bark has been taken to make tan,
will do well; or if the bark is liked, apple-tree
or elm boughs will be suitable. That these sticks
should be rough and gnarled and knotted adds
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
to their effect. As the tub will be only partly
covered with rustic mosaic work, it will be well
before nailing anything upon it to paint it. A
good dark brown or chocolate will go well with the
natural bark. The rustic pieces will have to be
cut through with the saw, the lengths being too
great to be safely split with the hatchet&mdash;that
is, with the exception of those round the lip,
which are of thicker rod than the zig-zags; say,
1&frac12; in. as compared with 1 in. In the zig-zags the
light central strip is supposed to be of peeled
withy, the darker ones on each side having the
bark on, and being probably of hazel. Generally
speaking, wrought brads are to be recommended
for fixing rustic mosaic, but where, as in the
present case, the strips have to be bent over a
curved surface, small wire nails will be found
more secure. Groups of fir cones, as shown, will
prettily ornament the triangular spaces.</p>

<p>A style of foot suitable for a one-leg flower
stand or table is illustrated in plan and part
section by <a href="#Fig_32">Fig. 32</a>.</p>

      </span>
    </div>

<p><a href="#Fig_33">Fig. 33</a> shows the other half of the cask arranged
for, say, a dwarf shrub, an orange-tree,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
or the like. In small town or suburban premises,
such tubs are specially useful where there is a
back court into which anything green cannot
otherwise be introduced. In this, it will be seen
that by way of variety the tops of the staves
have been sawn to a zig-zag line, which is followed
a little below by a moulding of split rods. Alternative
styles of moulding are shown by <a href="#Fig_34">Figs. 34</a>
and <a href="#Fig_35">35</a>. Half-way between this and the bottom a
band of mosaic is arranged in light and dark
strips of withy and hazel. The bits filling the
diamond-shaped centres of this pattern are cut
from thicker stuff than the rest, so that they may
project as bosses beyond the general level. Over
the unavoidable iron hoop at bottom, from which
place short strips would, if nailed, be often detached,
a rough "dry-cask" wooden hoop has
been fixed. At the sides two pieces of rough
branch stuff have been placed to serve as handles,
and to resist strain these should be secured from
within by strong screws.</p>

<p>The vase shown by <a href="#Fig_36">Fig. 36</a> is intended for a
somewhat low-growing flowering plant&mdash;say, a
large bushy geranium. In its original character
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
it is an American lard pail. As in the last tub,
the staves have been sawn to a more ornamental
outline, and they have also been perforated.
The ornamental strips of split rod have been
arranged in straight vertical lines, to avoid the
difficulty of bending and keeping them in place
if bent round so small a vessel. The bottom of
the pail is screwed down to an octagonal slab of
wood, to the under side of which four short bits
of rough bough are nailed as feet. As neither this
nor the last tub is wholly covered with mosaic,
they should, of course, first be painted. The slab
at bottom will look very well rough, as shown, but
if painted it will be improved by strips of split
rod nailed round its edges.</p>

<p>A garden plant stand, made from a soap box
and mounted on legs is shown by <a href="#Fig_37">Fig. 37</a>. The easiest
way to fix one of these legs on is to saw the piece
of stuff in half to a distance from the top equal
to the depth of the box, and then to cross-cut and
remove one half. The corner of the box will be
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
brought to the middle of the cross-cut, and the leg
nailed on to the side of the box. The piece which
has been sawn off will then be cut through (quartered),
and the proper quarter replaced and
nailed to the end of the box. Frets, such as those
shown in these two examples, are patterns of a
kind well adapted to be worked out in rustic
mosaic.</p>

<p>A design for a rustic flower-pot stand in imitation
of bamboo is represented by <a href="#Fig_41">Fig. 41</a>. The
height should be about 2 ft. 6 in. to the top, and
the length from 3 ft. to 3 ft. 6 in. The box at
the top may be about 9 in. wide and 8 in. deep.
Care must be taken when putting the work together
to get the frames true and square. Slovenliness
in construction will completely spoil the
appearance of the finished article. The box at
the top is made to fit inside, and should be lined
with a zinc tray. The outside may be covered
with glue and brown sawdust.</p>

  Fig. 42.&mdash;Square Table.</span><br />
  </span>
</div>

<p>A small rustic table which may, if desired, be
used as a flower-pot stand, is illustrated by
<a href="#Fig_42">Fig. 42</a>. The top may be made of &frac34;-in. stuff, and
should have two ledges nailed underneath to
prevent twisting. The table may be 1 ft. 10 in.
high, with the top 15 in. square, or, if a larger
size is required, 2 ft. 1 in. high, with the top
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
18 in. square. The design is not suitable for
tables of a larger size.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
 <a name="Fig_43" id="Fig_43"></a>
  <img src="images/i_036__fig43.jpg" width="500" height="601" alt="Fig. 43.&mdash;Hexagonal Table." title="" />
  <span class="caption"><span style="font-size:.8em">
  Fig. 43.&mdash;Hexagonal Table.</span><br />
  </span>
</div>

<p>The legs may be secured to the top by boring
holes in the ledges and driving them in. The
cross bars must be firmly secured to the legs, and,
for the joints, the mortise and tenon shown at
<a href="#Fig_6">Fig. 6</a> (see p. 14) would be suitable. If the sticks
used to form the legs are rather small, it will
be better if the cross bars are kept a little
higher on two of the sides, so that the mortises
do not meet each other.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>The top is covered with a Swiss overlay pattern,
made of split sticks. The design may be set
out by drawing lines from corner to corner on
the top, and across the top in the centre of each
side. A smaller square is then drawn in the
centre of the top, with diagonals at right angles
to the sides of the top. Lines drawn from the
corners of the small square to the corners of the
top will form a four-pointed star. The pattern
should be clearly outlined with a pencil. In
nailing on the sticks, those round the outer edge
of the top should be put on first and mitred at
the corners. Next the outside sticks of the small
square should be nailed on, then the eight pieces
from the corners of the small square to the corners
of the top.</p>

</div>

<p>In working up patterns of the above description,
always nail on the sticks that follow the
outline of the design first. The filling-in pieces
may be put on afterwards. Variety may be given
to the patterns by using sticks of different colours;
for instance, the design may be outlined in hazel
or blackthorn, and filled in with hawthorn or
peeled willow. The edges of the table top are
concealed by nailing on an edging of short sticks
or cones.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_43">Fig. 43</a> shows a small hexagon-top table for
use in a summer-house or on the lawn. The following
dimensions are suitable: Height 2 ft. 6 in.,
and diameter of circle for the hexagon top
2 ft. 9 in. The top is made from two or three
<sup><span style="font-size:.7em">7</span></sup>/<span style="font-size:.7em">8</span>-in. boards cramped together to the required
width and fixed underneath with two battens
3&frac12; in. wide by 1 in. thick. The four legs are
dowelled and nailed to these battens and further
stiffened by the rungs and the diagonal braces
which are nailed to the legs. A corona is fixed
around the edges of the table top, and the method
of securing the board is shown in <a href="#Fig_44">Fig. 44</a>. In
<a href="#Fig_45">Fig. 45</a> the half plans show two ways of ornamenting
the top. The twigs should be sawn so
that in section they are less than a semicircle,
and it will be an advantage to shoot their edges
slightly, as then they will fit closer and cover
the rough boards that form the table top.</p>

the wood, when dry, can be finished in stain and
outside varnish.</p>

<p>The garden-seats about to be described will
look very effective if made of oak that has had
the bark removed and the small twigs trimmed
off clean; they should be finished in stain and
varnish. In construction they are fairly simple.</p>

      </span>
    </div>

<p>For making the seat shown by <a href="#Fig_49">Fig. 49</a>, first
select the three back posts, with their natural
curves as much alike as possible. In diameter
they should be from 2&frac12; in. to 3 in. Select also
two arm-posts and one centre leg for the front.
Next cut two seat rails for the back and one
rail for the front, 5 ft. or 6 ft. long as desired,
and cut two side rails (see <a href="#Fig_50">Fig. 50</a>) and one centre
rail, each 1 ft. 7 in. long. Work the ends of the
rails to the shape of the posts as shown by <a href="#Fig_51">Figs.
51</a> and <a href="#Fig_52">52</a>, so that they make a fairly good joint,
and bore the posts and rails with a <sup><span style="font-size:.7em">7</span></sup>/<span style="font-size:.7em">8</span>-in. bit 1&frac14; in.
deep, to receive dowels made of ash or elm. These
are preferable to tenons formed on the rails
themselves. Now try the whole together temporarily,
and make good any defects.</p>

<p>Measure off and mark equal spaces for the
struts, the ends of which are trimmed to fit the
rails and posts. Secure them with two nails at
each end. The seat (<a href="#Fig_53">Fig. 53</a>) is made up of split
saplings laid as shown, with the ends pared to
fit the rails and bradded on. Finally, fit the struts
between the seat rails and the lower part of the

<p>The framework for the chair shown by <a href="#Fig_54">Figs. 54</a>
and <a href="#Fig_55">55</a> is on the same principle as that already
described. The segmental battens forming the
seat run longitudinally, and their ends are shaped
to fit the outer rails. The battens rest on a flat
worked on the centre cross rail (see <a href="#Fig_55">Figs. 55</a>, <a href="#Fig_56">Fig. 56</a>,
and <a href="#Fig_57">Fig. 57</a>). <a href="#Fig_56">Fig. 56</a> also gives a part cross section
near the centre leg, and shows the front rail
placed out of centre and the cross rail resting
on the leg, to which it is firmly nailed. When the
seat is more than 5 ft. in length the battens require
intermediate supports, which can be cut
from split saplings. The panelling on the back
is fixed to the top and bottom rails and supported
in the centre by a wide longitudinal rail
and two vertical rails at the mitres of the diamond
centres. These are fitted in and secured,
and then the vertical split twigs are fixed partly
on them and also on the rails. Finally, struts
are fixed to the seat rails and legs and covered
with short twigs, with their lower ends running
in a regular curve.</p>

of its bark, and used in some parts only, will
form a pretty contrast with the darker rods.
In filling spaces in back and canopy, a few pieces
of crooked stuff are used; these will probably be
of apple-tree.</p>

<p>The two posts <span class="smcap">A</span>, on which almost the entire
weight is sustained, should be let into the ground
not less than 2 ft. They rise 5 ft. above the
ground-line. They are set at a distance, measuring
from centre to centre, of 4 ft. apart. The
smaller posts (marked <span class="smcap">B</span>), which support the seat,
stand 17 in. in advance of those last named, and
should be let into the earth 1 ft. The broad seat
thus given is essential to comfort when the back
of the chair is upright, as it must be in this
instance.</p>

<p>Two principal cross-pieces are nailed against
the main posts. The lower one, of halved stuff,
is 15 in. from the ground, and carries the back
of the seat. The other is close to the top of the
posts, and carries the back of the canopy. The
canopy is chiefly supported on the three wall-plates,
<span class="smcap">C</span> (<a href="#Fig_59">Fig. 59</a>), which rest at one end on the
heads of the posts, and towards the other on the
struts, <span class="smcap">D</span> (<a href="#Fig_60">Fig. 60</a>). Fig. 61 shows in plan the arrangement
of the principal pieces forming the
canopy: <span class="smcap">E E</span> are the rafters of the gables, the
lower ends of which rest on the wall-plates, and
the upper against the pinnacle, <span class="smcap">F</span> (<a href="#Fig_61">Fig. 61</a>). The
back rafters are marked <span class="smcap">G G</span>, and these rest their
lower ends on the cross-piece and their upper
against the pinnacle. <a href="#Fig_62">Fig. 62</a> shows the filling-in
of the two back panels of canopy; Fig. <a href="#Fig_63">Fig. 63</a> that
of the four side panels.</p>

<p>The filling-in of the back of the seat is clearly
shown in <a href="#Fig_59">Fig. 59</a>.</p>

<p>In <a href="#Fig_64">Fig. 64</a> the seat proper appears in plan.
Its front and ends are of halved stuff, nailed
to the posts. The spars forming the seat are
placed with spaces between them, that they may
not hold moisture; for the same reason, it is
advised that they should be of peeled withy.</p>

<p>In many gardens there is a space devoted to the
tool-house, potting shed, refuse head, etc. Shrubberies
of course hide the unsightly appearance
of this particular spot to a certain extent, but it
may be found desirable to close the entrance to
this part of the garden from the remainder, and
the gate illustrated in front elevation by <a href="#Fig_65">Fig. 65</a>
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
is, from its semi-rustic nature, particularly suitable.
<a href="#Fig_66">Fig. 66</a> shows a plan and <a href="#Fig_67">Fig. 67</a> is a part
back view. The gate is quite simple in construction,
and should be of sufficient height to obstruct
the view from each side.</p>

<a href="#Fig_65">Fig. 65</a> is constructed on a framework 6 ft. square,

<p>Cut the closing and hingeing stiles 6 ft. long
out of stuff 6 in. wide by 2&frac12; in. thick. The three
rails are of the same dimensions, and can be
halved and dovetailed to the stiles or, better,
mortised, tenoned, and wedged and braced, as
shown in <a href="#Fig_68">Figs. 68</a>, <a href="#Fig_69">69</a>, and <a href="#Fig_70">70</a>. Separate pieces of
stuff are fixed up the centre to form a muntin for

<p>Two stout gate hinges and hooks are required,
and they can be bolted on with 7/16-in. Whitworth
bolts and nuts, or secured from the back with
square-headed coach screws. Now commence fixing
on the unbarked twigs; they should be as
straight as possible and used in their natural
shape, without being split in halves.</p>

<p>The terminations of the joints for circular
stuff are slightly different from the ends of the
half-round stuff; see <a href="#Fig_71">Figs. 71</a> and <a href="#Fig_72">72</a>. Start by
fixing the outside square, then the two inner
squares, and finally the diagonal filling.</p>

<p>The posts are 9 in. or 10 in. in diameter by
9 ft. long, 3 ft. being underground. Cut three
mortises in the posts to receive the rails for the
side fencing. These rails are nailed flush to the
secondary posts, nails also being driven through
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
each mortise in the gate posts. Next dig the
holes for the posts, these being kept at correct
distances apart by nailing battens to the top and
at the ground line while ramming in the posts.
Two parts of old brickwork and one part of
Portland cement will make a good concrete for
the posts.</p>

<p>A week or more should elapse before the gate
is hung to the posts. This may then be propped
up fair between the two posts, and the positions
should be marked for the staple of the latch,
and hooks for the hinges. A rebate is formed for
the gate on the posts by nailing on split sapling;
see <a href="#Fig_67">Figs. 67</a> and <a href="#Fig_73">73</a>. Finally, a short post can
be driven in the ground and fitted with a hook
for retaining the gate when open wide.</p>

<p>Suitable designs for small rustic gates are
given by <a href="#Fig_74">Figs. 74</a> to <a href="#Fig_77">77</a>. The wood for making
gates to the two designs (<a href="#Fig_76">Figs. 76</a> and <a href="#Fig_77">77</a>) should
have the bark removed. The chief rails and posts
are about 2 in. thick, filled in with 1&frac12;-in. or 1-in.
pieces, halved and nailed together where they
cross. The joints may be hidden by bosses of
planed wood (see <a href="#Fig_77">Fig. 77</a>). If the gate is to be
removable, fix a hook on the hanging stile to engage
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
with a staple in the joint, and a pin in the
bottom to turn round in a socket. The gate is
then easily taken out of its hangings. Varnish
the wood on completion.</p>

<p>Rustic fences can be constructed as shown in
<a href="#Fig_78">Figs. 78</a> to <a href="#Fig_80">80</a>.</p>

<p>The garden trellis illustrated at <a href="#Fig_81">Fig. 81</a> will
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
form an attractive addition to the grounds of a
suburban or country villa residence. In the case
of new houses, the existence of such a trellis,
with creepers ready planted, will often prove a
deciding factor in effecting a quick sale or letting.
The structure extends to a length of about 20 ft.,
but the dimensions may readily be altered to
suit requirements. The material may be fir or
other straight unbarked saplings and twigs. The
posts are 12 ft. long; the four for the arch being
4 in. in diameter, and the others 3 in. or 3&frac12; in.
The rails are 2&frac12; in. in diameter, and the twigs for
the trellis, etc., 1&frac34; in. or 2 in. The bay seat with
canopy is 6 ft. long by 1 ft. 4 in. wide.</p>

materially to the stiffness of the framework, making
long shores unnecessary. The shores are
placed 3 ft. 6 in. above the ground line, and are
inclined at an angle of 50°. The posts are sunk
into the ground a distance of 3 ft., and well
rammed in; rubble stones being mixed with the
earth, as shown in the vertical section (<a href="#Fig_83">Fig. 83</a>).</p>

      <span class="caption"><span style="font-size:.8em">
      Fig. 86.&mdash;Alternative Design for Gate.</span><br />
      </span>
    </div>

<p>The arch may with advantage be entirely fitted
together before being put in position, as a better
job can thus be made of the joints of the short
rails and struts. The joints in the remainder of
the work, with the exception of the gate, are of
the simplest description. The rail ends are
bevelled and notched to the posts, and secured
with nails as shown in the sectional view of the
trellis at <a href="#Fig_84">Fig. 84</a>.</p>

<p>Having erected the framework in position,
next sink and well ram the shores deep into the
ground, and splay and nail the top ends to the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
uprights. Also fix the shorter posts for the seats,
letting them into the ground about 1 ft. 6 in. The
end seat bearers are fixed to the end posts, and
the centre bearers to the front and back central
posts. The seat battens are saplings split in two,
the flat portion being laid downwards and nailed
to the bearers (see <a href="#Fig_83">Fig. 83</a>). <a href="#Fig_85">Fig. 85</a> is an enlarged
section through the seat back, showing
the method of securing the smaller twigs to the
rails. The fixing of the vertical pieces in the
lower part, and the inclined lengths above, will
complete this portion of the screen.</p>

<p>The gate, shown enlarged at <a href="#Fig_86">Fig. 86</a>, which
gives an alternative design, is 3 ft. 9 in. wide
by 4 ft. 6 in. high. The stiles are 4 ft. 9 in. long
and about 2&frac12; in. in diameter, and should be as
straight as possible, with the twigs neatly trimmed
on; the rails should be at least 2&frac14; in. in diameter,
trimmed to fit the stiles, and secured with inserted
hardwood dowels 1 in. in diameter, as
shown at <a href="#Fig_26">Fig. 26</a>, p. 27.</p>

<p>The diagonal struts in the top panel should be
fitted and in place before the rails and stiles are
finally secured; the vertical twigs in the lower
panel should be similarly fitted and nailed before
the rails are secured to the stiles. Ordinary
forged hooks and eyes are used for hanging the
gate; these are secured to the stile and post with
nuts and washers, as shown in the enlarged horizontal
section (<a href="#Fig_87">Fig. 87</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">

  <span class="caption"><span style="font-size:.8em">
  Fig. 87.&mdash;Method of Hanging and Latching Gate.</span><br />
  </span>
</div>

<p>A mortice is cut in the closing stile to receive
the latch, the catch for the latter being a simple
forging (see <a href="#Fig_88">Fig. 88</a>) with a pointed tang for
driving into the post.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>A rustic carriage entrance is shown by <a href="#Fig_89">Fig. 89</a>.
The intention is, of course, that the rustic archway
above the gates shall be more or less clothed
with climbing plants. It is for roses that the
structure will be best adapted, though clematis
or honeysuckle will look well upon it. Ivy would
look too heavy, and, if neglected, might even
prove too heavy in other respects. Light as the
arch may appear, the four posts grouped to form
the turret on either side are so tied and braced
together as to be, to all intents and purposes, a
solid pillar, 30 in. square, and fully equal to
resisting any outward thrust of the rafters. In
the elevation (<a href="#Fig_89">Fig. 89</a>), to avoid confusion, no indication
is given of the work forming the farther
side of the arch, though something of it would
necessarily be seen from the front; the two sides
will be alike. <a href="#Fig_89">Figs. 89</a> and <a href="#Fig_90">90</a> are drawn to a
scale of &frac12; in. to the foot.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 200px;">

  <span class="caption"><span style="font-size:.8em">
  Fig. 88.&mdash;Catch for Gate.</span><br />
  </span>
</div>

<p>The posts, and at least all the more important
straight pieces, should be of larch. The wood
chosen for filling-in should have picturesque forks
and contortions. Small oak bangles will, perhaps,
be most appropriate.</p>

<p>In the ground plan of the left-hand turret
(<a href="#Fig_90">Fig. 90</a>) it will be seen that the posts used&mdash;four
at each end&mdash;are some 5 in. or 6 in. in diameter,
and that the largest is selected as hanging-post
for the gate. From centre to centre they are set
2 ft. 3 in. apart. They are 13 ft. long&mdash;that is,
10 ft. 4 in. above ground and 2 ft. 8 in. below.
The rafters of the arch spring from them 7 ft.
from the ground, and at this point each post is
surrounded by a cap, formed of four pieces of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
quartered stuff nailed upon it. The rafters are
not mortised into the post, but if, instead of being
merely nailed, they are attached by a bolt and
nut, a stronger joint will be made.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
 <a name="Fig_89" id="Fig_89"></a>

  <span class="caption"><span style="font-size:.8em">
  Fig. 89.&mdash;Elevation of Rustic Carriage Entrance.</span><br />
  </span>
</div>

<p>The upper rafters, back and front, are connected
by five straight cross-pieces, whose ends
show in <a href="#Fig_89">Fig. 89</a>. The spaces between these are
filled up very much at random with crooked
stuff.</p>

<p>The four posts of each turret are bound together
close beneath their tops by cross-pieces
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
nailed outside them, whilst from their tops, and
nailed down to them, slant four short rafters,
which meet pyramid-wise in the centre. The
filling up of the upper parts of the turrets, as
well as of the front and back of the arch, is
with a mixture of straight and crooked stuff,
the arrangement of which is clearly shown in the
elevation (<a href="#Fig_89">Fig. 89</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

  <span class="caption"><span style="font-size:.8em">
  Fig. 90.&mdash;Plan of Left Side of Carriage Entrance.</span><br />
  </span>
</div>

<p>The lower parts of the turrets and the gates
must be constructed in such a way as to exclude
animals; the palings are so arranged as not to
leave a space between them wider than 3 in. The
rails of the gates should, of course, be mortised
into the heads and hinge-trees.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a></h2>

<h3>ROSERY WALK.</h3>


<p>The rustic construction here illustrated is intended
primarily as a trellis over which to train
roses, and to form a shady and fragrant walk, and
generally to contribute to the adornment of the
flower garden. It can readily be adapted so as
to form a roofed-in track from a door to the
public roadway; and the means of so adapting it
will be explained later.</p>

<p>The materials will be entirely rough wood in
its natural bark. For the posts fir poles of some
kind should be chosen, and larch is especially
to be preferred both as regards durability and
appearance. All the smaller pieces which show as
straight stuff may well be of the same kind of
wood as the posts, though hazel is best for the
finer rods. It will be seen that in the mere filling-in
much crooked stuff is used, and for this apple
branches, or indeed almost anything that comes
to hand, will answer.</p>

<p>The rosery walk (<a href="#Fig_91">Fig. 91</a>) is 4 ft. wide, and
the rustic erection is carried on two rows of
pillars or collar-posts ranged at intervals of 3 ft.
These posts should be let into the ground 2 ft.,
and well rammed in. They should have an average
diameter of 3 in. or 3&frac12; in., except in the case
of each third one, as that which in <a href="#Fig_91">Fig. 91</a> is seen
standing in the middle of the portion with the
lower roof; such pillars may be smaller as having
little weight to bear, and will look better than
they would do if equal in size to the others. Resting
on the line of posts lies the wall-plate (<span class="smcap">A A</span>,
<a href="#Fig_92">Fig. 92</a>), the top of which is 5 ft. 6 in. from the
ground line.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>From each group of four large collar-posts
rise four rafters (<span class="smcap">B, B</span>, <a href="#Fig_92">Fig. 92</a>), meeting at top
pyramid-wise. They rise to a height from the
ground of 7 ft. 6 in., and have, therefore, to be
3 ft. 4 in. long. Half-way up them&mdash;that is,
6 ft. 6 in. from the ground line&mdash;the purlins
(<span class="smcap">C, C</span>, <a href="#Fig_92">Fig. 92</a>) are nailed upon them. <a href="#Fig_91">Figs. 91</a>
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
and 92 alike show how the space between wall-plate
and purlin is filled in, and <a href="#Fig_92">Fig. 92</a> shows
how the space, 7 ft. 3 in. long, stretching from
one pyramidal portion to the next, is covered
with a flat roof of open rustic work lying upon
the purlins. This space, it will be observed, is
chiefly filled in with crooked stuff.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_93">Fig. 93</a> shows how the upper part of the rosery
would appear at one of its ends, and explains
how the roof would be in section&mdash;the shaded
parts give the form of the roof in its lower portions;
whilst if the cross-piece, <span class="smcap">D</span> (which is on a
level with the purlins), is supposed to be removed,
there is presented with the dotted lines, <span class="smcap">B, B</span>, a
section through the middle of one of the higher
pyramidal portions.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">

  <span class="caption"><span style="font-size:.8em">
  Fig. 93.&mdash;Entrance to Rosery Walk.</span><br />
  </span>
</div>

<p>Over the middle of the entrance is a rough
knot or a piece of root.</p>

<p>The filling-in of the sides of the rosery is
plainly shown in the elevation, <a href="#Fig_91">Fig. 91</a>. For its
better preservation from damp, this work is kept
4 in. from the ground.</p>

<p>Supposing that, as was suggested above, the
design is to be utilised for a dry path with a
covering of metal or other light material, it will
be well to keep the whole roof to the level of the
pyramidal portions&mdash;a ridge-piece will have to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
be used&mdash;and the rafters, instead of following
the present arrangement, will meet in pairs opposite
to the pillars. Instead of round stuff,
also, use halved stuff for the rafters and purlins,
the sawn side being uppermost. The space between
ridge-piece and purlin can then be filled
in the same manner as that between purlin and
wall-plate.</p>

<h3>PORCHES.</h3>


<p>The rustic porch shown in front elevation by
<a href="#Fig_94">Fig. 94</a> and in vertical section by <a href="#Fig_95">Fig. 95</a> is constructed
from straight, well-seasoned saplings and
twigs, from which, in each case, the bark has
been removed. The design is eminently suitable
for a farmhouse or a country cottage. The porch
is of large dimensions, and is provided with seating
accommodation on each side. The seats do
not appear in the elevations, but one side is shown
in the part plan (<a href="#Fig_96">Fig. 96</a>).</p>

<p>The seats are 1 ft. 6 in. high by 1 ft. 2 in. wide.
The battens are 1&frac34; in. wide by 1&frac12; in. thick, and are
supported on cross-pieces fixed to the front posts
and wall; a centre batten being fixed to the centre
panel, and supported by a diagonal bracket running
from the front down to the sill-piece. The
floor space is 7 ft. wide, and stands out 5 ft. from
the walls.</p>

<p>The posts are 7 ft. 6 in. long by 4 in. in diameter.
The front posts are preferably dropped
over metal dowels leaded into the stone floor, at
1 ft. 2 in. centres, while the side posts are at 10&frac12; in.
centres, and of smaller section&mdash;say about 3 in. in
diameter. One post, 5 in. in diameter, sawn
longitudinally through the centre, does duty for
the two wall-posts, the flat portion being, of
course, scribed to the wall, the latter having
been previously plugged for the reception of the
fixing nails.</p>

<p>The rails are tenoned to the posts, and 1&frac14; in.
diameter holes are bored in the posts, and also in
the ends of the rails, for the reception of the inserted
tenons. The ends of the rails are also
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
hollowed to fit roughly the posts (see <a href="#Fig_97">Fig. 97</a>).
The lower rail is 10 in. up from the floor, while
the centre rail is 3 ft. 4 in. up. The rail immediately
below (<a href="#Fig_95">Fig. 95</a>) is 10 in. below the
centre rail.</p>

</div>

<p>The top ends of the front posts are hollowed,
and fitted with inserted dowels for the reception
of the front rail. The six side-posts are finished
off square, and have tenons which fit into the
plates. The front ends of the plates are notched
to the front top rail. The rafters are 5 ft. 7 in.
long by 3 in. deep and 2 in. wide, wrought and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
chamfered and birdsmouthed to the plates as
shown at <a href="#Fig_98">Fig. 98</a>. The ridge piece, 4 in. deep
by 1&frac12; in. thick, projects 5 ft. 2 in. from the wall.
On the front end of the ridge is fixed the finial,
which is 2 in. square. The rafters are covered
with 1-in. V-jointed, wrought, grooved and tongued
boarding, cut in 5-ft. 4-in. lengths, and laid
horizontally or at right angles to the rafters.</p>

</div>

<p>The roof may be covered with slates, with
Broseley tiles, with wood shingles, or with thatch.
A part plan of the roof is shown in <a href="#Fig_99">Fig. 99</a>. An
enlarged section of the front angle of the gable
is given in <a href="#Fig_100">Fig. 100</a>. Two boards, each 1 ft. 1 in.
wide by 1&frac14; in. thick, are fixed to the outer rafters
and run parallel with them; the heels of the two
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
boards abutting on the front top rail, to which
they are nailed. The split-twig herringbone ornament
is also nailed to these boards. On the inner
edges of the boards are secured twigs of about
1&frac34;-in. in diameter, which are rebated to fit to the
edges as shown in <a href="#Fig_100">Fig. 100</a>. The front projecting
ends of the roofing boards are concealed by split
twigs of about 2&frac12;-in. or 3-in. diameter, which do
duty as bargeboards. The method is shown at
<span class="smcap">A</span> (<a href="#Fig_100">Fig. 100</a>).</p>

<p>The panels have now to be filled with stuff
ranging from 1&frac12; in. to 2&frac14; in. in diameter. The
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
vertically placed twigs between the posts and rails
should be fitted in place before the rails are finally
jointed up to the posts. The ends are roughly
hollowed, and are secured with cut nails. Alternatively,
the vertical members could be fitted so
that their inner edges coincided with the centre
of the rails. The major portion of the twigs
being on the outer side, the smaller diameter of
the twigs will thus bring their front edges flush
with the larger diameter edges of the rails. The
herringbone and the diagonally placed twigs are
quite easy to fit, the ends being simply pared off
till they are sufficiently shortened to assume their
correct position in the panels.</p>

<p>The decorative effect of the porch will be
greatly improved by the addition of a suitable
door, as shown in the front elevation (<a href="#Fig_94">Fig. 94</a>).
The cost of manufacture of such a door is but
slightly more than that of an ordinary six-panel
door. The bottle ends in the top glazed panel
form a quaint and pleasing feature of the general
scheme.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_101">Fig. 101</a> is a general view of the canopy and

however, being exactly the same. The
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
material used is stripped fir saplings. Six of
these are required for the uprights.</p>

<p>The middle posts are slightly larger in section,
as they have to carry the cross rail supporting
the swing; a good size for these is 6-in. diameter
at the base by 10 ft. or 12 ft. high. The outer
posts may be 4&frac34;-in. to 5-in. diameter at the base.
The posts are sub-tenoned (see <a href="#Fig_103">Fig. 103</a>) to elm
sills 10 ft. 6 in. long by 8 in. diameter. Tenons
are formed on both ends of the posts, and seatings
and mortices at 4-ft. centres are made in both the
sills (bottom rails) and plates (top rails) to receive
them.</p>

<p>The middle cross rail which carries the swing
is 6 in. in diameter and 8 ft. 6 in. long. A seating
is formed on the plates, and a shallow one
upon the rails, which are secured with long 3/4-in.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
diameter bolts and nuts; the latter are let into
the posts at a distance of 8 in. from the top, as
shown in <a href="#Fig_105">Fig. 105</a>, which is a cross section through
the plate near the middle rail. Short struts may
also be fixed between the posts and cross rail, as
in <a href="#Fig_105">Fig. 105</a>; they are not shown in <a href="#Fig_101">Fig. 101</a>. A
floor is formed of saplings, connected to the sills,
thus preventing them from spreading. The trellis-work,
both on the roof and sides, is now fixed.
This is composed of 1&frac34;-in. and 2-in. twigs.</p>

<p>The swing hooks (<a href="#Fig_106">Fig. 106</a>) pass right through
the rails, and are secured with nuts and washers.
Collars should be forged on the shanks to prevent
the hooks being drawn too far into the wood
when screwing up the nuts. The shank is screwed
&frac34;-in. Whitworth pitch thread, and the hook is
1&frac14; in. in diameter at the thickest part. The hemp
rope is spliced around galvanised iron thimbles
(see <a href="#Fig_107">Fig. 107</a>), which take the wear on the hooks.
The rope is usually secured to the seat by simply
knotting the ends.</p>

<p>Should the swing be used for very young
children, a seat provided with a fence will be
necessary, as shown at <a href="#Fig_108">Figs. 108</a> and <a href="#Fig_109">109</a>, which
are front and end views respectively. The back
rail and the two side rails are fixed to the seat
with the balusters; but the front rail is tenoned
to open-ended mortices in the side rails, and thus
made to hinge, to facilitate the lifting of the
children on and off the seat, the rail being secured
in its closed position with a brass pin and retaining
chain. The suspending rope in this case is
passed through the end rails and knotted to the
seat. <a href="#Fig_110">Fig. 110</a> shows the rope passed around and
whipped to an eyelet.</p>

<h3>AVIARY.</h3>


<p>The outside dimensions of the rustic aviary shown
by <a href="#Fig_111">Figs. 111</a> and <a href="#Fig_112">112</a> are&mdash;length, 3 ft. 2 in.;
width, 1 ft. 6 in.; height, 1 ft. 10 in.</p>

<p>Hazel sticks, with the bark on, should be used,
the straightest obtainable being best for the
frame; if at all crooked or bent, the sticks can be
straightened by steaming, or, if not too dry, by
the heat of a spirit lamp.</p>

<p>Four uprights, 1 ft. 5&frac12; in. by <sup><span style="font-size:.7em">5</span></sup>/<span style="font-size:.7em">8</span> in., are first
cut; then six rails, &frac12; in. thick, are made, with the
ends shaped as shown in <a href="#Fig_113">Fig. 113</a>, to fit the uprights,
measuring 2 ft. 10 in. inside the hollow
ends when finished. Four of these should be laid
on the bench side by side, and marked with a pair
of compasses for the wires, which are <sup><span style="font-size:.7em">5</span></sup>/<span style="font-size:.7em">8</span> in. apart.
They are then drilled, the holes being bored right
through the two sticks for the top rails, but
only half through the bottom rails. If the stuff
is not too hard, the holes may be pierced with a
well-sharpened brad awl.</p>

<p>The uprights are now secured to the rails with
2-in. wire nails, driven so as to avoid the holes
(see <a href="#Fig_114">Fig. 114</a>), and glue is applied at the joints.
The bottom rail is flush with the lower ends, the
next one being placed &frac12; in. above it; the third
is &frac14; in. from the top ends. These form the front
and back frames, and should be quite square and
out of winding. The rails for the ends, also
six in number, measure 1 ft. 3 in., and are bored
and fixed to the uprights to correspond with the
others in exactly the same way.</p>

<p>The two rails supporting the tree perches are
placed about 7 in. from the ends. Before they
are fixed, however, the tree perches must be arranged.
These should be cut from the limb of a
leafless tree, in winter, in order to retain the bark.
Suitable pieces may be prepared by cutting off
badly placed twigs and fixing them where required.
They are then put on the perch rails,
employing the same joint as the rails and upright,
but securing with a strong screw.</p>

rails of the back and ends, to be faced with split
stuff, put on diagonally as shown in <a href="#Fig_111">Figs. 111</a> and

quantity of material to the nearest sawmill to
be divided by a circular or band saw; the material
must be free from grit, or objections will be raised
against cutting it.</p>

<p>A stain, made by thinning down brunswick
black with turps, should be at hand to stain
the wood before fixing on the split stuff, which
is secured with fine panel pins.</p>

<p>The wiring is all straightforward work. The
wires are passed through the top rails to those
below and clipped off level at the top. Six feeding-holes
are required, one in the centre at each
end, and two at the back and front close to the
perches. The top ends of these wires are pushed
up through the rails; the circular ends are
slightly sunk and fixed with small staples. Six
wires are omitted from the middle of the front
to allow for the door. The cross-wires, which
should be of a stronger gauge, are then put in.
In the back and ends it is immaterial whether
they are put inside or out, but at the front they
must be inside. The six wires above the door are
inserted in twos, being returned in the same manner
as the lower ends of the door wires (see <a href="#Fig_118">Fig. 118</a>),
and soldered to the cross-wire, which is afterwards
bound to the others with thin pliable
coil wire. In making the sliding door, the returned
ends of the wires are soldered to the base
wire inside, so that the ends may fit round the
wires of the doorway; the top ends fit round those
above the cross-wire, and when the door is in
place a scroll-piece is soldered on outside (see
<a href="#Fig_111">Fig. 111</a>).</p>

    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
board are next got out for the top, measuring
2 ft. 10 in. long, 4 in. across the centre, and
slanting at the upper edge to &frac14; in. at the ends.
The design is worked on these in split, the boards
being kept in place with pins driven through the
top rails, and the back and front connected at the
top point by a length of wood of 2-in. by 1-in.
section (see <a href="#Fig_119">Fig. 119</a>). The roof-pieces, 1 ft. 5&frac12; in.

<p>A sliding bottom or tray is required for cleaning
purposes; this is of &frac14; in. board, and is nailed
to the strip that fits between the rails in front;
other strips about 1 in. wide are nailed on the
upper side at the extreme ends and back edge
to form a tray for the sand, runners being put in
against the lower end rails. The front strip is
treated with the split, and to draw out the tray,
the door may be slightly raised to admit the fingers
to push it forward from the inside. Two
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
additional perches put across from the wires,
and fixed with staples, give strength to the front
and back.</p>

<p>The aviary is now gone over with fine glass-paper,
all white places being touched up with the
stain and nicely varnished, with the exception
of the perches. The aviary will stand on a table,
but may be hung from the ceiling if desired.
For hanging purposes, four screw-eyes are put in
the top, two on the ridge, about 3 in. from the
front and back, and one towards each end, placed
midway to catch the rails. The four ceiling hooks
should screw into the joists, the aviary being suspended
with chains.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_121">Fig. 121</a> is a perspective view of a rustic foot-bridge
suitable for a span of 8 ft. or 12 ft. The
banks of the stream to be bridged are excavated
to allow of the building of a low rubble wall, on
which the sleepers rest, as shown in <a href="#Fig_122">Fig. 122</a>. The
girders are formed of spruce or larch spars. In
the present instance, four are used; and they
may be 8 in. or 10 in. in diameter, according to
the length of the span. They are roughly adzed
down to sit on the sleepers, and each girder is
also worked down tolerably flat on the inner
sides. The girders are then bolted together in
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
pairs with six &frac34; in. diameter coach bolts, as shown
by <a href="#Fig_123">Fig. 123</a>. The posts are tenoned and wedged
to fit mortices in the girders. <a href="#Fig_124">Figs. 124</a> and <a href="#Fig_125">125</a>
show the mortice and tenon joint.</p>

<p>If the bridge happens to be in a locality that
is subject to periodical flooding, it should be
anchored to prevent its being unseated by flood
water. The anchoring can be best effected by
driving four short piles into the soil on the inside
of both girders and near their ends. The girders
can be fastened to the piles with coach bolts.
The tops of the piles will be concealed by the end
floor battens. The smaller twigs forming the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
ornamentation are now fixed, and <a href="#Fig_129">Fig. 129</a> shows
the vertical piece hollowed to fit the rails.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_130">Fig. 130</a> gives a part view, in longitudinal
section, of an elevated bridge, suitable for a
span of 12 ft. to 18 ft., and raised on piles to
enable small boats and canoes to pass under.
Elm logs are suitable for the pile foundation.
An iron ring must be fitted over the tops of the
logs while they are being driven, and it will
be necessary to use a pile-driver. The logs, having
been sufficiently driven, are cut off to the
required height from the ground line. Three
piles on each side are required to carry the
sleepers. The bridge is 5 ft. 6 in. wide, and the
spars for girders are 12 in. in diameter. The
sleepers are bolted to the piles, and the girders
are also bolted to the sleepers as shown by
<a href="#Fig_131">Fig. 131</a>. A row of smaller piles is now driven,
and a plank, 11 in. by 3 in., is housed to the
top ends of these piles, and also connected to the
projecting ends of the girders. The treads of the
steps rest upon the tops of the smaller piles, and
the outer side of the piles and planks is covered
with split saplings (see <a href="#Fig_130">Fig. 130</a>, and the cross-section,
<a href="#Fig_132">Fig. 132</a>). The handrails and balustrades
are fixed in similar manner to those in
<a href="#Fig_121">Fig. 121</a>.</p>

<h3>VERANDAHS.</h3>


<p>The front elevation of a rustic verandah is presented
by <a href="#Fig_133">Fig. 133</a>, which shows a part only,
which may be extended to any required length at
either end. As to the width, that indicated is
3&frac12; ft. from the wall to the middle of the collar-posts,
the eaves having a further projection of
6 in. For a cottage verandah the width given
is a satisfactory one. It gives sufficient room
for seats on a hot day, or for a promenade on a
wet one. The width, as also the height, can
easily be increased to suit a larger house. The
verandah is supposed to be built on a raised
platform of brick or stone.</p>

<p>All parts of the actual framework are of
straight natural wood, preferably larch; whilst
the mere filling-in of rustic open-work is of small
crooked stuff&mdash;probably oak or apple tree. The
roof, as illustrated, is of tiles.</p>

<p>It will be seen that the posts which support
the verandah are arranged in pairs, so that 3 in.
or 3&frac12; in. poles will suffice for them. Their bases
are supposed to be dowelled to the masonry of
the platform on which they stand; they are 6 ft.
6 in. high. Except at the entrances, a sill of
half-stuff runs from post to post on the platform.
At a height of 3 ft. 3 in. they are connected
by a round bar of smaller material, and,
again, by a second cross-bar of similar size to
the last, at 6 in. from their upper ends. On
the tops of the posts rests a lintel of half-stuff of
larger diameter&mdash;say 5 in. The upper and lower
cross-bars come opposite to the middles of the
posts, but need not be mortised into them, for
if their ends are cut V-shaped, so as to clip the
posts, they can be nailed quite firmly.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;">
 <a name="Fig_133" id="Fig_133"></a>
  <img src="images/i_098__fig133.jpg" width="650" height="494" alt="Fig. 133.&mdash;Front Elevation of Verandah." title="" />
  <span class="caption"><span style="font-size:.8em">
  Fig. 133.&mdash;Front Elevation of Verandah.</span><br />
  </span>
</div>

<p>The lower cross-rail is placed at a convenient height for
leaning upon. At a height of 5 ft. 6 in. caps are
formed by simply nailing four pieces of quartered
stuff round each post. The diagonal braces
which start from above the capitals pass in front
of the upper cross-bars, to which and to the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
lintel they are nailed. <a href="#Fig_133">Fig. 133</a> sufficiently
shows how the panels between the pairs of posts
and the frieze between the upper cross-bar and
lintel are filled with open-work of small crooked
branches, which contrasts in a pleasing manner
with the straight pieces of the framework. This
open-work may be made available for, and will
be found useful as, a support for climbing plants.</p>

<p>In so narrow a structure the rafters alone will
suffice to keep all in place, without anything of
the nature of a tie-beam being called for. These
rafters will be of half-stuff, and for the given
width a length of 5 ft. will be enough; this will
allow of such a projection beyond the lintel as
will give the eaves a width of 6 in.; the pitch will
be rather less than a true pitch, but amply steep
for the purpose. A piece of half-stuff nailed to
the wall will support the upper ends of the
rafters.</p>

<p>In forming the roof it is proposed to board
over the whole space upon the rafters, and to
nail the tiles or other covering upon the boards.
The inside may be lined beneath the boarding with
rush matting. This is an inexpensive material;
its brownish-green hue is pleasing to the eye, and
it is so inartificial in appearance as to harmonise
well with the natural wood. After fixing the
rafters, the matting is to be stretched tightly
across them before the boards are nailed down. It
is probable that the rafters will be arranged with
intervals of about a foot between them, and to
hold the matting more closely to the boards a
strip of split rod may be nailed up the middle
of each space, or strips may be nailed so as to
form a simple ornamental pattern; an intricate
one will not be desirable, as fixing it will be overhead
work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<p>A neat, but less characteristic, ceiling may be
formed by painting the boards a suitable colour
and slightly ornamenting them with split strips
of rod. In this case the boards should be planed.
None will be better for this purpose than &frac34; in.
flooring boards, and these are commonly sold
planed on one side. Other ways of lining the
roofs of rustic buildings are discussed in Chapter
XIII. For summer-houses thatch makes a good-looking
roof, but a thatched verandah would
scarcely be desirable unless attached to a
thatched cottage. Practically the choice lies between
shingles, metal, and tile or slate. A metal
roof is, undoubtedly, that most easily fixed by the
beginner; black sheet iron looks better than galvanised,
and must be kept painted. As a matter
of taste, metal looks thin and poor, but it becomes
less objectionable when painted; a deep,
dull red would be the colour to be preferred.
Perhaps, of all available coverings, nothing will
look better than tiles, as drawn. Red or buff
tiles will in themselves look best, but the choice
must, to an extent, be influenced by the general
covering of the house. It may be, if that is of
slate, that small slates will come in most appropriately;
but whichever of these coverings is used,
the best finish against the wall will be with a
"flashing" of metal, as shown.</p>

<p>It has been asserted by some who consider
themselves authorities in matters of taste that
nothing of the nature of a greenhouse ever harmonises
with natural surroundings, or is otherwise
than an eyesore in a garden in other respects
beautiful. The hard, straight lines of wood
or metal, and wide surfaces of shining glass, are
not pleasing, and are too suggestive of the shop
and factory to accord well with natural objects.
It has been suggested that the difficulty might be
overcome by combining rustic work with glass.
This, at the first glance, looks fairly easy; but, on
consideration, it will be seen to be otherwise. Rustic
carpentry is in its nature irregular, and cannot
be brought to those level planes and straight
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
lines essential to glass-work; whilst for interiors,
and especially those of houses intended for vines,
rough bark-coloured surfaces afford too much shelter
to insect pests&mdash;so that, in reality, rustic-work
can only be made applicable to a very
limited extent. In the grape-growing verandah
shown by <a href="#Fig_134">Fig. 134</a>, therefore, only a limited
amount of rustic-work has been introduced, and
that on the outside.</p>

<p>Such of the materials as are of a rustic kind
     <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
are, for the parapet and uprights, some rather
small larch poles or other tolerably straight,
round stuff, and for the panels, some of those
"slabs," or rough outside planks. As to the
posts, and such parts as are not rustic, they are
supposed to be of good deal. The sash-bars, which
carry the glass both in roof and walls, are to be
bought struck by steam at a lower price than they
can be worked by hand, or sashes may be bought
ready glazed. For glazing work of this kind,
16-oz., or sometimes 20-oz., glass is used.</p>

<p>As in the design for an open rustic verandah
(see <a href="#Fig_133">Fig. 133</a>) it is intended that the collar-posts
should be set upon and dowelled into a raised
platform of masonry. The present structure is,
of course, intended for the warmer sides of a
house, south or west. The width, to meet particular
cases, can be varied, but is, according
to the drawings, 4&frac12; ft. The posts are 6 ft. high
and 3&frac12; in. square. They are set with spaces between
them alternately of 3 ft. and 4&frac12; ft. On
their tops rests a wall-plate of the same width
as themselves, and 2&frac12; in. deep. The rafters, which
are sash-bars rebated to carry the glass, rest on
this wall-plate, and against a second vertical
one fixed to the house wall.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_134">Fig. 134</a> is a front elevation of a portion of
the verandah, whilst <a href="#Fig_135">Fig. 135</a> gives a side view
of the lower half of one of the collar-posts. At <i>a</i>,
in <a href="#Fig_135">Fig. 135</a>, is seen the section of the upper
cross-rail, which has its top 2&frac12; ft. from the
ground; at <i>b</i> is the lower cross-rail, or sill. Both
are of quartered rough stuff, and are mortised
to the post &frac34; in. from its inner edge, so that
when the &frac34; in. boarding, <i>c</i>, is nailed against them,
it will come flush with the inner side of the post.
At <i>d</i> is indicated the sash-frame, with its rebate
for glass, which occupies the upper part of the
opening; and at <i>e</i> is a metal flashing between
rail and sash to throw off rain. It is proposed
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
that the sashes in the narrower openings only
should be made to push outwards at bottom for
ventilation. At <i>f</i> is a piece of halved rough stuff
nailed to the front of the post.</p>

<p>The panels, which occupy the lower part of
the space between the collar-posts, are filled with
pieces of rough plank or "slab," as shown in
<a href="#Fig_134">Fig. 134</a>. These pieces should wear their natural
bark as far as possible; they are nailed to the
inner boarding.</p>

<p>In <a href="#Fig_136">Fig. 136</a> the upper part of a post is in
like manner shown in profile: <i>g</i> is the wall-plate
in section, and <i>h</i> is the lower end of a rafter.
At <i>i</i> will be observed a strip of quartered stuff
nailed across the post (with a fir-cone bradded
beneath it), which gives a starting-point to the
upright <i>k</i>, by which the openwork rustic parapet
is supported. These uprights are of small round
stuff, slightly flattened on the side towards the
post. The openwork parapet is too plainly
figured to need description; it is intended to break
to a certain extent the straight lines, and partially
to conceal the glass-work of the roof, without
seriously interfering with sunshine.</p>

<p>So much of the planed wood-work as shows outside
should be painted of a good brown, to
assimilate with the rustic-work.</p>

    Fig. 138.&mdash;Side Elevation of Rustic Tool House.</span><br />
  </span>
</div>

<p>For the small rustic tool house shown by <a href="#Fig_137">Figs. 137</a>
and <a href="#Fig_138">138</a> the materials used are what are known
as "slabs" or "rough planks." These are cheap,
and have, when judiciously handled, a good picturesque
effect. These slabs are the outside slices
cut from logs of rough timber. These slabs generally
retain their bark (except in the case of oak),
and in most districts they will commonly be of
elm. Their thickness and outlines are necessarily
irregular: one end will frequently be narrower
than the other; and this will account for the
arrangement seen in the walls and door of the
tool house. They are to be bought at saw-mills,
and often sold at a fire-wood price. Where their
cost is not sensibly increased by carriage, no other
material comes so cheaply for building rough
sheds. The ordinary country way of using them
is as in the horizontal section, <a href="#Fig_139">Fig. 139</a>. This
plan, however, is not suitable for the present
     ,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
purpose. In so small a structure, rough planks
on the inner side would take up too much space
It is, therefore, proposed to straighten the edges,
either by sawing or by chopping with the axe, according
to circumstances, and lining their inner
sides with thin board. If the cost be not objected
to, &frac12; in. match-boarding will be neatest
for this purpose; if economy is an object, the
boards of packing-boxes, bought from the grocer,
might suffice. There are, it will be seen, three
sides only to be lined.</p>

<p>Among a lot of rough planks, it is likely that
stuff may be found sufficient for the posts and
other scantling. As to the six pilasters, which
are added for appearance merely, it is possible
that stuff might be found which would, when sawn
to width, do for them; in the illustration they
are supposed to be fir poles or elm saplings;
four sticks only are needed to supply the six
halves and four quarters used.</p>

<p>At the corners are four main posts, 4 in.
square (see <i>a</i>, <a href="#Fig_140">Fig. 140</a>). These enclose a space
of 7 ft. by 5 ft. (outside measurement). They
are let into the ground 2 ft., and rise 5 ft. 3 in.
above the ground line.</p>

<p>On their tops, and coming flush with their
outer edges, rest the wall-plates, which are 3 in.
deep; these are needed at the back and sides only,
and not at the front. On the same three sides
will also be cross-rails, 2 in. to 3 in. thick, the
ends of which will be let flush into the posts about
a foot from the ground. To the wall-plates and
these rails the slabs are nailed. In the side elevation,
<a href="#Fig_138">Fig. 138</a>, the nails driven into the cross-rails
appear, but not those driven into the wallplate,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
a piece of rough stuff being there shown as
fixed over the latter to support the eaves of the
thatch.</p>

  </span>
</div>

<p>To the front are to be seen the two door-posts,
<i>b</i>, <i>b</i>, <a href="#Fig_140">Fig. 140</a>, which are 2 ft. 8 in. apart, and
should be about 3 in. square. As their tops are
nailed to the front pair of rafters, they rise to
a height of 6 ft. 6 in. The space between door-post
and corner-post is filled up by a single slab
nailed to the two&mdash;5 ft. 6 in. long by 10 in. broad.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
Above these, instead of a wall-plate, comes the
piece of strong slab, shown in <a href="#Fig_137">Fig. 137</a> as having
an opening cut in it for the head of the door.
This is nailed against the door-posts, rafters, etc.</p>

<p>The pilasters are only a matter of ornament.
As drawn, they are of halved stuff; the corner
ones are so placed that their middles come opposite
to the corners of the posts, on the other
faces of which pieces of quartered stuff are nailed
to meet them. The simple arrangement of the
caps of these pilasters, with their decorations of
fir cones, is shown on a larger scale in <a href="#Fig_141">Fig. 141</a>.
The horizontal piece beneath the eaves, nailed
over the slabs, has the effect of resting on the
caps. Beneath the thatch at front and back corresponding
pieces are fixed, those at the front being
ornamented with fir cones nailed upon them.</p>

<p>The roof is shown in the elevations as thatched.
No other covering will look so well, or be so
thoroughly in keeping with other parts. The non-professional
builder finds it easy to prepare for
thatch, any rough stuff serving as rafters and
laths, and inequalities being of no account. The
rafters for thatch should be arranged about 1 ft.,
the laths about 6 in. apart.</p>

<p>Should there, however, be reasons for not employing
thatch, the building may be more quickly
and easily, if not more cheaply, roofed with galvanised
iron; only the gables will then best be
made sharp instead of blunt, as at present.</p>

<p>Regarding the door, its outer slabs, which appear
in <a href="#Fig_137">Fig. 137</a>, are simply nailed to three
ledgers of the same. Being of such rough
materials, it will open better if hung on hooks
and thimbles than on butt hinges.</p>

<p>The dotted line at <i>c</i>, <a href="#Fig_140">Fig. 140</a>, marks the projection
of a set of shelves, about five in number,
which fill the whole of the left-hand side. Of
these, the lower will be for flower-pots, the upper
for lines, setting-pins, trowels, etc. At <i>d</i> is
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
shown a strip of wood fixed across the floor to hold
the wheel of the barrow from running back when
that useful vehicle is tilted up against the end
wall, which will be the place assigned for it. In
the gable and upper part of this end will be
hooks or pegs on which to hang the riddle, watering-cans,
and such matters. At <i>e</i> is an upright
let into the ground, which, at the height of 2 ft.,
supports rails running to side and back; these
form a kind of stand for spades, forks, and tools
of that description. Above, against the wall-plate,
may be more hooks or pegs.</p>

<p>It is suggested that at <i>f</i> a seat might be fixed
to fold down like the leaf of a table when not
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
wanted. As this building would form a snug
shelter in a shower, such a seat would be a convenience;
but the more important use of this
space is that slightly below the level of the eaves
it will be fitted with a rack for hoes, rakes, and
similar implements. Such a rack is best made by
boring &frac12; in. holes in a strip of wood at intervals
of 3 in., and driving pegs into them 5 in. or 6 in.
long. This has to be nailed so that the pegs will
slope upwards, at an angle of about 45°. Rakes,
etc., hung in a rack so made cannot fall.</p>

<p>The garden snuggery, of which a general view
is shown at <a href="#Fig_142">Fig. 142</a>, and a ground plan at <a href="#Fig_143">Fig. 143</a>,
is built chiefly of wood, and measures 10 ft.
by 7 ft. 8 in. inside, not including the porch,
which is 3 ft. wide; it may serve as a summer-house.
A building as small as this needs but
little foundation. If the ground is level, it is
only necessary to lay four large flat stones on the
surface, <span class="smcap">A A</span> (<a href="#Fig_144">Fig. 144</a>), to carry the timbers, the
floor being thus raised enough to keep it dry.</p>

long, 6 in. wide, and 4 in. thick, and rest on the
stones; on them lie the end sills <span class="smcap">C C</span>, which are
8 ft. 2 in. long. These sills are halved together
at the ends, and a hole is bored through them
where the middle of the collar-post will rest. This
hole should be bored a couple of inches into the
stone, and an iron pin or dowel 8 in. long driven
in; the pin will thus stand a couple of inches
above the face of the sill, and will fit into a
hole in the collar post.</p>

<p>The joists <span class="smcap">D</span> (<a href="#Fig_143">Fig. 143</a>) for supporting the floor
are five in number, each being 8 ft. long, 2&frac12; in.
wide, and 3 in. deep. They are halved for a distance
of 2 in. at each end to fit into slots, 1&frac12; in.
deep, made for them in the sills, and are nailed
in place. When fixed their upper surfaces are
level with the sills.</p>

<p>The four collar-posts <span class="smcap">E</span> (<a href="#Fig_143">Figs. 143</a> and <a href="#Fig_144">144</a>) are
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
each 6 ft. 9 in. long and 4 in. square, and, when
set up, their outer sides come flush with the sills.
The uprights <span class="smcap">F</span> (<a href="#Fig_143">Figs. 143</a> and <a href="#Fig_144">144</a>) are 3 in.
square, and need to be 2 in. longer than the
collar-posts, as their lower ends are halved for
this distance to fit slots in the outer sides of the
sills. There are four of such uprights at each
side, three at the back and two at the front, the
latter serving also as door cheeks. They are
nailed in place with their outer sides flush with
those of the collar-posts and sills.</p>

<p>For the rustic pillars of the portico <span class="smcap">G</span> (<a href="#Fig_145">Fig. 145</a>)
nothing will be more suitable than larch
poles about 4&frac12; in. in diameter at the base; failing
larch, fairly straight pieces of any rough, round
wood could be used. The pillars are shown in
<a href="#Fig_142">Figs. 142</a> and <a href="#Fig_145">145</a> standing upon and dowelled to
pieces of stone. When in position, their tops
will be level with the collar-posts and uprights,
their centres being 2 ft. 4 in. in advance of the
front sill.</p>

<p>On the collar-posts, uprights, and pillars are
placed the wall plates <span class="smcap">H</span> (<a href="#Fig_144">Fig. 144</a>), of which there
are four belonging to the snuggery proper, each
5 in. wide and 3 in. thick. The side plates are
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
13 ft. 4 in. long, and are halved where they rest
on the collar-posts and pillars, to receive the ends
of the cross-plates, which are 8 ft. 2 in. long and
halved to a distance of 5 in. from their ends.
The wall-plates come flush with the collar-posts
and uprights on which they rest, and to which
they are nailed. There is also a fifth wall-plate
which lies along the tops of the pillars in the
front. The best material to use for this would
be half of a pole like those used for the pillars,
the flat side resting on the pillar tops. It will
be observed that the front ends of the side wall-plates
project about 4 in. beyond this piece.</p>

<p>Ten rafters, <span class="smcap">K</span> (<a href="#Fig_144">Fig. 144</a>), will be required
for the roof, each 5 ft. long and 3 in. square.
The two outer pairs come flush with the outer
sides of the sills and wall-plates. A sixth pair of
rafters to stand over the pillars and their wall-plates
are made from a round pole cut in half,
with the sawn side laid uppermost. The tops of
the rafters butt against a ridge-piece <span class="smcap">L</span> (<a href="#Fig_144">Fig. 144</a>),
made of 1-in. board 4 in. deep and 13 ft. 4 in.
long. As shown in <a href="#Fig_144">Fig. 144</a>, continuations of the
uprights are in the back carried from the wall-plate
to the roof, the front being treated in a
similar manner.</p>

<p>The lintel of the doorway is 6 ft. above the
sill, the door opening being 5 ft. 11&frac14; in. by
2 ft. 6 in. after the floor has been laid. The window
shown in <a href="#Fig_142">Fig. 142</a> is 3 ft. above the sill,
and is 3 ft. high; including the two mullions,
it is 5 ft. 10 in. wide. The board shown nailed
in front of the window sill is sloped a little downwards
to throw off the rain, whilst above there is
a board 9 in. wide, nailed at a steeper slope upon
brackets, as seen in <a href="#Fig_146">Fig. 146</a>, to shelter the window.
The &frac34; in. flooring boards which are used
for the floor should be bought ready planed on
one side, and must be well seasoned, and cramped
tightly together in laying, or there will be chinks
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
between them. Similar boards may be used for
the outside of the snuggery, being nailed to the
uprights at the back and sides, as shown in
<a href="#Fig_147">Fig. 147</a>. At the sides this weather-boarding will
extend as far forward as the rustic pillars, thus
enclosing the sides of the porch. For the inside
of the snuggery use &frac12; in. matchboarding, as shown
in <a href="#Fig_147">Fig. 147</a>. This may be carried up beneath
the rafters to the ridge-piece. The porch may be
also matchboarded throughout if desired, although
this is not essential.</p>

<p>There are several methods of making the
wooden walls non-conductors of heat, the most
thorough being to pack the space between the
inner and outer casings with sawdust. Shavings
or similar materials could also be used, but less
effectually. Another plan is to tack felt over the
inner side of the weather-boarding before nailing
up the interior casing. But even without any
packing, two thicknesses of board with an air
space between make a reasonably good non-conductor.
Felt is fastened over the matchboard
lining of the roof before the iron is put on.</p>

<p>To reduce the cost, the snuggery can be cased
with wood obtained from packing cases. Boards
thus obtained will, of course, be in short lengths,
and will involve more labour; but the design is
so arranged that it will be quite practicable to
carry it out with them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>The short lengths can
be made to fit between the uprights instead of
lying upon them, and the house will thus look as
shown in <a href="#Fig_142">Fig. 142</a>, the section of the wall being
as shown in <a href="#Fig_148">Fig. 148</a>, instead of as in <a href="#Fig_147">Fig. 147</a>.
A strip of lath&mdash;that sold for tiling&mdash;1 in. wide
and <sup><span style="font-size:.7em">5</span></sup>/<span style="font-size:.7em">8</span> in. thick, is nailed to the sides of the uprights,
as shown, and to this the weather-boarding
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
and internal casing are fastened; the effect being
that the walls both inside and out appear to be
divided into long panels. The effect may be
heightened by painting the framework a darker
colour than the boarding. In boarding the roof
with this material, the easiest plan will be to nail
the pieces on the upper sides of the rafters, to
cover them with felt, and upon that to screw
the iron. The space between the two casings of
the walls, although much narrower than before,
can be packed with sawdust, etc.</p>

<p>On reference to <a href="#Fig_145">Fig. 145</a> it will be seen that
the caps to the rustic pillars of the porch are
formed by nailing round each pillar four short
pieces of rough wood quartered, the two sawn
sides being placed upwards and inwards. Four
rough sticks crossing each other fill the space between
wall-plate and the rafters. The bargeboards
<span class="smcap">M M</span> are sawn from &frac34;-in. board, 9 in. wide,
and are nailed to the ends of the side wall-plates
and ridge-piece. They thus project some inches beyond
the line of the pillars. They are shown
ornamented with fir cones bradded on them; virgin
cork might be used instead. The porch may
also have its interior decorated with virgin cork
or with rustic mosaic work. At each side of the
doorway there is a seat 16 in. high and 14 in.
wide. The door is made by merely nailing the
boards to four cross-ledgers.</p>

<p>The window lights in <a href="#Fig_142">Fig. 142</a> are shown filled
with fancy lead work, which is the most suitable
way of treating them for a building of this kind.
A strip of lath is nailed around the window opening,
as in <a href="#Fig_148">Fig. 148</a>, and the leaded light fastened
in the rebate thus formed with small wire nails,
a little putty being used to make the joints
waterproof. It will, of course, be much cheaper
to glaze each light with a single sheet of glass
puttied in the rebate, but the effect will not be
so good. For the roof, fourteen 6-ft. sheets of
corrugated galvanised iron and a 14-ft. run of
ridge capping will be needed.</p>

  <span class="caption"><span style="font-size:.8em">

<p>The iron should
be screwed, not nailed, to the rafters, and should
not cost more than 40s., including 1&frac12; gross of
galvanised screws and washers. The dotted lines
at <span class="smcap">N N</span> (<a href="#Fig_143">Fig. 143</a>) indicate the area covered. Its
low cost, the ease with which it is fixed, and the
few timbers required to carry it, make an iron
roof very suitable for a building erected by an
amateur workman. It, however, has drawbacks,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
the chief of which are that it conducts heat too
freely, and has not a very artistic appearance.
Some precautions against the first defect have already
been suggested, and if the snuggery is
erected where it will be shaded by trees during
the hotter part of the day, this disadvantage will
be somewhat overcome. Its inartistic appearance
is greatly due to its colour, and some improvement
may be made by painting. If surrounded
by trees, an iron roof looks very well when
painted a reddish-brown colour, while in other
situations a buff, or a dull sage green, might be
suitable. The paint needs renewing often.
Another method is to cover the roof with trellis
work raised a few inches above the iron, and upon
this to train ivy or other climbing plants.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

  </span>
</div>

<p>It will be better to paint the inside of the
snuggery than to paper it, as paper would crack
on the boards. Should the second and cheaper
plan of boarding be adopted, the rafters, which
are left exposed, might be coloured dark brown,
and the intermediate spaces of the ceiling painted
a buff colour, whilst on the walls a dark sage green
might be used for the framework and a lighter
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
sage green for the panels. If the whole interior is
lined with matchboarding, according to the first
method, the simplest and perhaps best finish
would be to use a varnish that had raw or burnt
umber ground into it. No fireplace has been provided,
but in ordinary winter weather an oil
stove would suffice to warm so small a room; if
more warmth is wanted, a coal stove might easily
be provided, a hole for its pipe being cut through
the roof. In either case a ventilator, which can
be opened or closed at pleasure, should be arranged
near the ridge at each end of the building.</p>

<p>The garden retreat shown in front view by
<a href="#Fig_149">Fig. 149</a>, and in plan and side elevation by <a href="#Fig_150">Figs. 150</a>
and <a href="#Fig_151">151</a>, is constructed from straight unbarked
fir saplings, the small twigs of which should be
carefully trimmed off. As the bark is to be left
on, it should not be cut or bruised; then no artificial
finish will be necessary, the bark in itself
being sufficient protection against climatic conditions,
and presenting the desired rustic appearance.
A new feature in the design is the introduction
of a roof or canopy, which may be covered
with a sun blind as shown in <a href="#Fig_151">Fig. 151</a>; or a creeping
plant may be trained over it.</p>

<p>The two front posts are 3 in. in diameter at
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
the base by 6 ft. high, and the back posts 3 in. in
diameter by 5 ft. 6 in. high; the middle back
post is 3 ft. 2 in. high, and the front leg 1 ft. 4 in.
The seat rails are 2&frac12; in. in diameter. The front
rail is 6 ft. long; the back is in two parts,
dowelled to the middle post, which comes between.
The side rails are 1 ft. 9 in. long; it is advisable
to allow a fair margin for hollowing the ends
to fit the posts&mdash;3 in. on the length would probably
be sufficient. After the ends of the rails
have been shaped roughly to fit the posts, they
are bored for the reception of 1<sup><span style="font-size:.7em">1</span></sup>/<span style="font-size:.7em">8</span>-in. oak or elm
dowels; these are driven into the rails, and should
also be a good fit in the posts. The dowel joint
is shown in the top corner of <a href="#Fig_152">Fig. 152</a>.</p>

<p>The lower rungs, arm-rests, and back rails are
jointed to the posts by tapering their ends
slightly, and then tapering the dowel holes to
suit with a gouge, so that the rails will just
drive up nicely; this joint is shown in the bottom
corner of <a href="#Fig_152">Fig. 152</a>2. The rails, etc., are finally
driven home, and secured with nails or screws inserted
at suitable angles. The back and the side
panels are filled with twigs about 1&frac14; in. in diameter,
the ends of the twigs being trimmed to fit
the rails, and afterwards nailed in position.</p>

<p>The seat battens are half-round in section, and
are cut from 3-in. saplings, the flat part being
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
placed downwards. The method of fixing them is
shown in <a href="#Fig_152">Figs. 152</a>, <a href="#Fig_156">156</a>, and <a href="#Fig_157">157</a>. The seat having
been fitted, the struts under the seat rails are next
cut and fixed in position.</p>

<p>The canopy must now be put together. The
tops of the posts are first hollowed to form a seating
for 2&frac14;-in. saplings, 4 ft. 6 in. long; these act
as principal rafters. Before nailing or screwing
them to the posts, it is advisable to sight across
them to see if they are in the same plane; any
alteration that may be required to bring them
to lie in the same angle can be effected at the
seating on the top of the posts. The halved joint
at each end of the principals should also be cut
(before fixing up) for receiving the purlins; the
principals are further steadied with struts,
screwed or nailed to the posts. The purlins are
about 2 in. in diameter by 8 ft. 6 in. long, and are
fixed to the halved joint previously made on the
principal rafters. Smaller twigs, which act as
common rafters, are in turn fixed to the purlins.

<h3>SUMMER-HOUSES.</h3>


<p>The lean-to summer-house shown by <a href="#Fig_158">Fig. 158</a> is
intended for a small garden. Perhaps in no better
way can a dead wall or the back of some
unsightly outhouse be better utilised than as the
background for such a building. The dimensions
of the structure are: length, 8 ft.; breadth,
3 ft. 3 in.; height, 8 ft.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 680px;">

    Fig. 159.&mdash;Ground Plan of Lean-to Summer-house.</span><br />
  </span>
</div>

<p>Its general arrangement is seen in the ground
plan (<a href="#Fig_159">Fig. 159</a>). Four pillars, <span class="smcap">A, B, B, A</span>, occupy
the front. These are poles 3&frac12; in. or 4 in. in
diameter. Any rough and tolerably straight wood
will do, but larch is to be preferred. These rise
5 ft. above ground, and should not have less
than 2 ft. below the surface. The dwarf pillars <span class="smcap">C</span>
supporting the seat are of similar stuff, but
rather smaller. They show 14 in. above, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
should be buried about 9 in. below ground. The
pilasters <span class="smcap">D</span> are of rather larger stuff sawn in half.
These are only 5 ft. long, as they need not enter
into the ground, being fixed only by strong nails
to the wall.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 458px;">
 <a name="Fig_160" id="Fig_160"></a>
  <img src="images/i_127__fig160.jpg" width="458" height="700" alt="Fig. 160.&mdash;Elevation of Inside of End of Lean-to

  <span class="caption"><span style="font-size:.8em">
    Fig. 160.&mdash;Elevation of Inside of End of Lean-to Summer-house.</span><br />
  </span>
</div>

<p>The ends of the summer-house (the space
from <span class="smcap">A</span> to <span class="smcap">D</span>) are of smaller half-stuff, ranged
side by side (as seen at <span class="smcap">E, E</span>), and nailed to the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
cross-pieces, <span class="smcap">F</span> and <span class="smcap">G</span>, which appear in <a href="#Fig_160">Fig. 160</a>.
In this last-named figure also appears one of the
wall-plates, resting on and nailed to the tops
of the pillars (<span class="smcap">H</span>, at <a href="#Fig_160">Fig. 160</a>), and at <span class="smcap">I</span> is seen
where one of the front wall-plates meets it. There
are two of these front wall-plates, each resting on
the two pillars to right and left of the entrance,
and their inner ends appear in <a href="#Fig_158">Fig. 158</a>, where the
ends of the purlins which form the small gable
rest upon them. The wall-plates are of large
half-stuff, with the flat side above. In <a href="#Fig_160">Fig. 160</a>
will be seen how the short cross-piece which carries
the sloping end of the roof is supported; and
<a href="#Fig_161">Fig. 161</a>, which is a section through the centre of
the building, explains how the ridge-piece of the
small gable, <span class="smcap">E</span>, rests at its inner end on a crosspiece
<span class="smcap">M</span> from rafter to rafter, seen in section
only, whilst <span class="smcap">N</span> shows the point at which the purlins
meet and support the ridge-piece towards its
outer end. The intersection of the diagonal
braces in the gable is indicated at <span class="smcap">O</span>, and <span class="smcap">P</span> shows
the course of one of the rafters, and how its
upper end rests against the wall, and upon a
ridge-piece of half-stuff, <span class="smcap">Q</span>, strongly nailed to the
masonry.</p>

<p>The elevation (<a href="#Fig_158">Fig. 158</a>) explains pretty clearly
the ornamental details of the front. They are
not elaborate. It will be seen that the top of
each pillar has a small cap, formed of four pieces
of quartered stuff, mitred at the corners, and
that across the opening on each side of the entrance,
near the top, is a "transom" of straight
wood, with a little arrangement of crooked bangles
round it. Over the entrance are diagonal
braces crossing, and also a little filling-in with
bangles. The entrance is 5 ft. 10 in. high.</p>

<p>In order that an ornamental and appropriate
lining may be given to the back of our summer-house,
it is recommended to plug the wall, and
nail over it a level covering of thin boards&mdash;say,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
&frac12;-in. matchboarding. Upon this the decorative
work can be bradded. The back of the seat
is shown in <a href="#Fig_158">Fig. 158</a> to be of rustic mosaic. Above
this, as well as under the seats, a covering of bark
has been introduced. British-grown bark, such
as elm, can be made to lie flat, but as in any
but rural districts this may be difficult to get,
virgin cork may be made to take its place.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_160">Fig. 160</a> gives an inside view of one of the
ends, and from this it will be seen that the ornamentation
of those parts varies little from that
of the back. The lower band, however, answering
to the strip under the seats, is not bark, which, in
this place, would be liable to be kicked and destroyed
by the feet, but of smaller half-stuff, so
arranged as to break joint with the outside pieces.
This will be seen by referring to the ground plan.
Any chinks in the ends should be neatly tucked
with moss, so as to make them wind-proof.</p>

<p>The roof is of wooden shingles&mdash;things which
any rough hand at carpentry can prepare and
put on for himself. As will be seen from <a href="#Fig_158">Fig. 158</a>,
it is easy to give an ornamental character to
these. They will have a rustic look, which will
go well with other parts of the structure, and, if
clumsily made, the effect will be none the worse.
For the present purpose, suppose the shingles to
be 12 in. by 4 in. The lower ends may be sawn
to a variety of ornamental shapes.</p>

<p>If this covering is used, instead of nailing
laths across the rafters, it is proposed to cover
the whole roof with similar boarding to the back,
and upon this it is a simple thing to nail the shingles,
placing them just as tiles might be placed.
Whilst nailing them on, it will be necessary to
have some person within to hold a heavy hammer
against the place, otherwise the vibration will jar
off the shingles as fast as they are fixed. A &frac34;-in.
board, rather wider than half the length of the
shingles, should first be nailed along the eaves
to make up the required thickness.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 425px;">
<a name="Fig_161" id="Fig_161"></a>
  <img src="images/i_130__fig161.jpg" width="425" height="700" alt="Fig. 161.&mdash;Section through Centre of Lean-to Summer-house." title="" />
  <span class="caption"><span style="font-size:.8em">
    Fig. 161.&mdash;Section through Centre of Lean-to Summer-house.</span><br />
  </span>
</div>

<p>It will be
noticed that the ends of the rafters are made to
project so as to give a good breadth of eaves&mdash;a
desirable feature in so narrow a building, alike
for shade, shelter, and the appearance of cosiness.
If, however, the roof should be thatched, the projecting
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
rafters will be unnecessary, as the thatch
alone will form sufficient eaves.</p>

<p>Down the "valleys" at the juncture of the
main roof and the entrance gable a strip of zinc
will, of course, be nailed before the shingles are
put on, whilst along the ridges a strip of zinc
will be nailed upon the shingles; and this latter
will need painting to match the colour of the
wood.</p>

<p>Various suggestions may be given for finishing
the inside of the roof. Supposing that round or
half-round larch stuff has been used for the
rafters (the latter is to be preferred for shingles,
as giving a level surface to board upon), the space
between the rafters may be covered with bark&mdash;virgin
cork or otherwise&mdash;the chinks being stuffed
with moss. But if this is done it will be well to
fix the bark with screws, as the vibration caused
by driving nails would displace or loosen the
shingles.</p>

<p>A second plan under the like circumstances
would be before nailing the boards upon the
rafters to stretch matting across the latter&mdash;either
ordinary garden bast matting or, better, the more
substantial rush matting, both of which are very
inexpensive. These have a pleasant natural
colour (the last-named especially, of a greenish
hue), and are so unartificial in their structure as
to appear in no way out of place among rustic
work.</p>

<p>Or it may so happen that suitable larch stuff
is not to hand, and that ordinary sawn scantling
has to be used for the rafters. If so, the
whole roof may be hung with ling; or the rush
matting may be stretched across the lower side
of the rafters and tacked there, being afterwards
more completely secured and finished by nailing
a split hazel or other rod down the middle of
each rafter. This last plan makes a neat and
pleasing roof.</p>

<p>It scarcely needs to be said that to make such
a summer-house look its best the wall on each
side ought to be covered with ivy or other
creepers; and it will also be obvious that, if the
height of the wall permits the floor of the summer-house
to be raised a step or two above the surrounding
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
level, the structure will gain thereby
both in effectiveness of appearance and in pleasantness
as a place in which to sit.</p>

<p>The rustic summer-house or tennis lawn shelter
illustrated in front and side elevations by <a href="#Fig_162">Figs. 162</a>
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
and <a href="#Fig_163">163</a> is constructed from straight saplings
and twigs that have had their bark removed, and
have been subjected to a reasonable period of
seasoning. A new feature in the design is the
accommodation under the seats for the reception
of the croquet or tennis gear, and also the extended
eaves and floor (see <a href="#Fig_164">Fig. 164</a>) and the open
front, giving at once an uninterrupted view of
the game and shelter from the direct rays of the
sun.</p>

<p>The shelter is 10 ft. long by 5 ft. 6 in. wide,
the height from the floor to the eaves being
6 ft. 3 in., and from the floor to the ridge 9 ft.
The four posts are 6 ft. 9 in. long by 6 in. in
diameter. The middle and lower end and the
back rails are tenoned to the posts, a flat being
formed on the post by the mortise and a corresponding
shoulder on the rails. The remaining
portion is worked to fit roughly the contour of
the post.</p>

<p>The plates are 5 in. by 5 in. in section, and are
secured to the posts with long galvanised bolts and
nuts and a 3&frac12;-in. square washer under the heads
of the bolts. When halving the front plate, allow
it to house into the side plates 1&frac12; in.; by this
method it will have a bearing on both posts. In
<a href="#Fig_165">Fig. 165</a> the left-hand plate represents the front.
The front posts are connected at the floor line by
a scantling, 4 in. by 3 in., which also forms a
sleeper for the floor joists; see <a href="#Fig_166">Figs. 166</a> and <a href="#Fig_167">167</a>.</p>

<p>The structure rests on a low plinth of bricks,
spaces being left for the circulation of air under
the floor.</p>

<p>The extended floor also rests on bricks placed
immediately below the joists; see <a href="#Fig_167">Fig. 167</a>, which
is a section on <span class="smcap">C D</span> (<a href="#Fig_164">Fig. 164</a>). The twig plinth
nailed around the front will effectually conceal
the sleeper and brick foundation.</p>

<p>The rafters are 2&frac12; in. by 3 in., and the ridge
and hip rafters 2 in. by 5 in., the finials (see
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
<a href="#Fig_168">Fig. 168</a>) being nailed between the angles of the
hips. The eaves in front project 2 ft. beyond the
posts, and <a href="#Fig_169">Fig. 169</a> shows the method by which
the additional width is obtained.</p>

<p>The sides are filled with <sup><span style="font-size:.7em">5</span></sup>/<span style="font-size:.7em">8</span>-in. vee-grooved and
tongued boarding, to which is attached the rustic
work.</p>

<p>The stained glass windows are fixed, and on
the outer side of the back are diagonal braces
made from split saplings, while in the centre a
vertical post runs from sill to plate.</p>

<p>The braces and post are shown in the plan
(<a href="#Fig_164">Fig. 164</a>).</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

<p>The seats are constructed to form lockers (see
<a href="#Fig_170">Fig. 170</a>, which is a section at <span class="smcap">A B</span>, <a href="#Fig_164">Fig. 164</a>), their
height being 1 ft. 3 in., which, with the addition
of a 3-in. cushion, will form comfortable sitting
accommodation.</p>

<p>The cushions are retained in place by straps
passing through slots and fastening over suitable
studs on the under side; see <a href="#Fig_171">Fig. 171</a>. This method
provides a means of easily removing and quickly
replacing the cushions when required for use.
A space of 3 in., or a distance equal to the thickness
of the cushions, must be left at the sloping
back, to allow the seat to open properly.</p>

<p>The nature of the locker is partly concealed
by the rustic work of split twigs that is nailed
to the front.</p>

<p>Next fix the lattice work between the finials
and under the front plate. The short struts on
the front posts are more for effect than for any
real support.</p>

<p>The roof is boarded on the inside, the work
being carried on the rafters as far as the collar
ties, and continued flat on these. Moulding is
fixed in the angles formed between the rafters
and ties, and a cornice is fixed at the plates. The
heels of the rafters and plates are also boarded
around, as shown in <a href="#Fig_169">Fig. 169</a>.</p>

<p>The roof may be covered with thatch of wheat,
straw, reeds, broom, or heather, and the whole
of the woodwork visible should be varnished.</p>

<p>The summer-house illustrated by <a href="#Fig_172">Fig. 172</a> is
suited to a garden of moderate size, one in which
space is not so restricted as to necessitate crowding
the building close against a wall. This octagonal
summer-house has a continuous seat some
15 ft. long. From side to side each way it measures
10 ft. <a href="#Fig_172">Fig. 172</a> is an elevation of the front
of the house.</p>

<p>Its framework and the main part of it are of
larch poles; other woods are, however, used for
minor purposes. The roof is of thatch. In the
arrangement of this building there is a certain
resemblance to a tent. It has a central pillar, <span class="smcap">A</span>,
not unlike a tent pole, which sustains much of
the weight of the roof. Being of first importance,
this pillar is somewhat larger than any of the
other timbers&mdash;say 6 in. in diameter near its
bottom, and tapering as little as may be. A
rod of iron or wood rises from its top to form
the centre of the straw pinnacle seen crowning the
roof in <a href="#Fig_172">Fig. 172</a>. This pillar shows a height of
11 ft. 2 in. above ground, and it should be let
3 ft. or more into the soil; for it will need to be
firmly fixed, or it may be forced out of the perpendicular
during the erection of the roof; when
the roof timbers are once fixed in place, it will
have little further chance of moving. The diagram
<a href="#Fig_173">Fig. 173</a> is a ground plan, and <a href="#Fig_174">Fig. 174</a>
is a section showing the timbers from the interior;
both are drawn on a scale of &frac14; in. to the
foot.</p>

<p>The eight collar-posts (<span class="smcap">B</span>, <a href="#Fig_173">Figs. 173</a> and <a href="#Fig_174">174</a>) at
the corners of the octagon are of somewhat smaller
stuff&mdash;say 4 in. They show 6 ft. above ground,
and should have 2 ft. below. It will be well to
gas-tar all the underground work.</p>

<p>The ground plan of a building in this shape
is readily laid out. The space being levelled, a
string is taken which has a loop at each end,
and is 5 ft. 2 in. long. With a stake driven
through the loop at one end as a centre, and with
a stick passed through the loop at the other to
serve as the travelling leg of the compasses, a
circle is struck 10 ft. 4 in. in diameter, and into
this pegs are driven at equal intervals (4 ft.
apart) to mark the centres of the eight collar-posts.
Whilst digging the holes for the posts,
these points are kept by drawing two straight
lines on the ground which intersect at the peg.</p>

<p>The cross-pieces which rest on the collar-posts,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
and which serve as wall-plates, are a trifle smaller
stuff than the posts&mdash;say 3 in. <a href="#Fig_175">Fig. 175</a> shows
how they are cut to fit the tops of the posts,
and nailed there. In this building there are no
mortise and tenon joints. On these ends above
the posts rest the lower ends of the eight main
rafters, <span class="smcap">D</span>, the upper ends of which rest against
and are nailed to the central pillar. The eight
intermediate rafters, <span class="smcap">E</span>, rest at the bottom on the
middles of the side plates, and at top are cut to
fit upon and between the tops of the main rafters.</p>

<p>The laths used are in this case in no way
particular&mdash;any sticks will do; they will not be
seen, and under thatch there is no necessity
that a level surface should be formed by them,
as for slates or tiles. They are nailed 6 in. or
8 in. apart.</p>

<p>The gable over the entrance is arranged as in
<a href="#Fig_176">Fig. 176</a>. The laths, when nailed on, will have
to run over the little ridge formed by <span class="smcap">F</span>, instead
of keeping the level, as on the other sides. This
will cause no special difficulties in the thatching.</p>

<p>The walls are of larch poles sawn in half.
To split a number of heavy poles with the handsaw
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
is tedious work, and it is better to get
them run through by the nearest steam saw. The
quantity of half-stuff required may be easily calculated;
one of these sides will take about five
and a half 6-ft. lengths of 4-in. stuff. The tops
of these wall-pieces are sawn obliquely to fit
against the round wall-plates to which they are
nailed. In their lower parts they are nailed to
the lower cross-pieces, <span class="smcap">G, G, G</span>, <a href="#Fig_174">Fig. 174</a>.</p>

<p>These latter will best be made of rather large
stuff quartered, since their upper sides on which
the seat-boards rest should be level, as well as
their backs, which go against the wall-pieces. The
middle cross-pieces are of smaller half-stuff, and
should be nailed to the wall-pieces rather than
that the wall-pieces should be nailed to them;
for they are in a conspicuous place, and nails
driven through them and clenched would be unsightly.</p>

<p>The front supports of the seats are let into
the ground some 6 in., and rise 14&frac12; in. above
the ground line. The seats should be cut from
1-in. board, and should be about 16&frac12; in. wide.</p>

<p>In the two window sides of the octagon (see
<a href="#Fig_177">Figs. 177</a> and <a href="#Fig_172">172</a>), the space below the windows
is filled with whole poles, their bottoms resting
on a sill let in level with the ground, and their
tops nailed into through a cross-piece of half-stuff
(<span class="smcap">K</span>, <a href="#Fig_177">Fig. 177</a>). The mullions and transoms
of the windows&mdash;mere sticks&mdash;are of small straight
larch stuff, but the ornamental filling in above
is of crooked branches&mdash;oak bangles by preference,
though apple-wood would do very well. It often
happens that an old apple-tree is cut down, and at
once condemned as firewood; yet its stem may
have grotesque knots, and its branches picturesque
contortions which would make it valuable for
rustic work. Whenever rustic building is contemplated,
it is well that such wood should be
laid by; a single tree would supply all the small
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
quantity of crooked stuff that is required in the
present instance. Even the interlaced stems of
ivy, when an old growth has covered a wall, have
sometimes been utilised to excellent effect.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 521px;">

  </span>
</div>

<p>It may be observed that any chinks between
the pieces beneath the windows, as well as in
the walls generally, are most readily and appropriately
rendered wind-proof by neatly stuffing
with moss. <a href="#Fig_177">Fig. 177</a> gives a full front elevation
of one of the window sides (they being only seen
obliquely in <a href="#Fig_172">Fig. 172</a>), and it is on the &frac12;-in. scale.</p>

<p>Four stout crooked pieces are used as struts to
support the table (drawn to 1 in. scale in <a href="#Fig_178">Figs. 178</a>
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
and <a href="#Fig_179">179</a>); 3/4-in. board will suffice for the top
of this table, and it will probably be cut from
two widths. To give proper strength to the ornamental
border (seen in <a href="#Fig_179">Fig. 179</a>), a second thickness
of the board is attached below each corner,
extending 3 or 4 in. to each side, so as to allow
each of the longer bits of split rod to be fixed,
as shown, with two brads.</p>

<p>A really satisfactory material in which to
finish the top of a rustic table is not easily found;
it must give a level surface, and at the same time
be in harmony with its surroundings. Board,
planed or painted, oilcloth, or any manufactured
material, is felt to be out of place; marble or
slate looks cold and hard. Nothing that is absolutely
level satisfies the requirements; the best
alternative is rustic mosaic. By this is meant
split rods of wood so bradded down as to form
patterns. For the present purpose, however, the
mosaic must be kept more neat and smooth than
usual. Fig. 178 shows the top of the table thus
treated.</p>

<p>The rods most in favour for rustic mosaic
are those of the hazel. They are to be bought
cheaply and abundantly when the undergrowth of
woods is cut. They have a smooth and pretty
bark, and the useful size is from &frac34; in. to 1&frac12; in.
Sticks of other kinds of the same size can also
be used: birch and wild cherry may be named
among those with smooth bark, and wych elm and
maple among those with rough; willow or withy,
again, is of most common growth, and exceedingly
useful. In river-side neighbourhoods it is often
the cheapest and most plentiful of all woods.
For mosaic work, it is always peeled, for its bark
is unattractive, and its light colour when stripped
makes it tell well in contrast to the dark bark
of other woods. If used, as it often is, for outdoor
purposes in garden carpentry, it should
always be peeled. Country carpenters have a
saying that withy lasts twice as long without its
bark as with it; and in this there is much truth,
for the loose bark holds the wet to the wood and
causes it to rot. To make it peel freely, it should
be cut just as the young leaves make their appearance.
The like holds good with other woods; but
if it is desired that the bark should hold firmly,
the wood should be cut down in dead of winter,
when all the sap is down.</p>

<p>The top of the table is supposed to be mainly
composed of peeled withy. The pattern contains
only the double dark line bounding the star and
the single strip round the edge in hazel. So much
white will not look amiss in this place, and withy
is easily worked. Hazel and most woods twist
so much in the grain that it is rarely safe to
split them except with the saw, but withy&mdash;in
short lengths like these, at least&mdash;can be split with
a hatchet.</p>

<p>In rough carpentry there is no more pretty or
interesting work than these mosaics. The backs
of the seats (<a href="#Fig_180">Fig. 180</a>), and the seats themselves
(<a href="#Fig_181">Fig. 181</a>), are decorated in this way. On the
seats themselves, as on the table top, hazel and
withy are contrasted, and form a design in alternate
triangles; the separating bands, it may be
noticed, have a light strip against the dark, and
a dark strip against the light, triangle. Along the
edge of the seats one or two strips merely are
nailed lengthwise. In such a situation an ornamental
edging like that round the table would
be too liable to be broken. It is recommended
that the back of the seats should be in dark bark-covered
woods only, for the mosaic in that position
will look better without any mixture of the light-coloured
withy.</p>

<p>The upper compartments of the sides with
which the backs of those sitting down will not
come in contact may be more quickly and yet
pleasingly covered with sheets of bark. Elm bark
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
is good for the purpose. It may be peeled in large
sheets from the trunks of trees felled in spring,
when the sap is rising; and whilst it is drying
should have bricks or stones laid on it to press
it flat. When dried, it is nailed to the walls, and
any cracks which appear can be neatly filled with
moss. The space beneath the seats is also shown
as roughly covered with bark.</p>

<p>The almost conical roof is thatched. No other
covering is so pleasing as thatch for a rustic building.
Its colour and rough texture harmonise well
with the natural wood, and all its associations
are of a rustic character; no other covering so
effectually excludes the summer heat, and nowhere
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
can one find a retreat so suggestive of coolness,
quiet, and repose, as under the low eaves
of a thatched building. Thatch has, it must be
admitted, certain practical disadvantages&mdash;birds
and winds are apt to scatter fragments from it,
and it needs renewing at comparatively short intervals.
The common saying is that a thatched
roof needs re-coating every ten years. Often,
no doubt, this is near the truth, yet really good
work will frequently stand for almost twenty
years. The materials in use in this country are
reeds, straw, and stubble. Reeds make a strong
thatch, but are not easily to be procured, except
in fenny districts. Stubble, which is the lower
and stronger part of the wheat stem, stands
better than straw, which is its upper and weaker
portion; to last properly, however, stubble should
be cut immediately after harvest, and should not
be left standing, as it frequently is, till the
spring, for then the winter rains, collecting in
its hollow stems, cause it to rot before it is cut.
On small buildings like summer-houses especially,
stubble makes a much more compact and sightly
roof than straw.</p>

<p>Thatching is not costly or difficult work. In
agricultural districts a load of stubble&mdash;sufficient
to thatch three such buildings as the one illustrated&mdash;costs
30s., and a thatcher expects the
wages of a first-class labourer only, not those
of a mechanic. He needs an assistant, whose business
it is to straighten the material into convenient
bundles (called "yelvens"), and to supply
him as he requires them. If he is re-thatching an
old building, he merely thrusts the ends of his
new material into the old thatch with a wooden
spud; but if he is covering a new roof he sews
down his "yelvens" to the laths and rafters with
a huge needle and stout tarred string. He begins
at the eaves, laying as wide a breadth as he can
conveniently reach on one side of his ladder, this
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
breadth being called a "stelch." He works upwards,
each new layer covering the tar-cord which
secures that beneath it; and thus he goes on till
he has reached the ridge.</p>

<p>In his second "stelch" he is careful to blend
together its edge and the edge of that already
laid, so that no rain may find its way between
them; and in doing this completely lies much of
the superiority of good over bad thatching. When
laid, the thatch is smoothed down and straightened
with a gigantic comb, like the head of a
large rake, one end being without teeth, and
serving as a handle. In the present instance,
the tops of all the stelches meeting in a point are
finished and capped by the little bundle of thatching
material forming the pinnacle, which is
tightly bound round the rod of wood or iron in
its centre.</p>

<p>It is usual to bind thatching down with at least
two belts of buckles and runners. In the summer-house
(<a href="#Fig_172">Fig. 172</a>) two double belts are shown. The
buckles have some resemblance to ladies' hair-pins
on a colossal scale. They are made of slips
of withy, twisted and doubled in their middles
and pointed at their ends; the runners are long
straight slips of the same. These latter are laid
across the thatch, and the buckles, being placed
over them, are pushed tightly into it&mdash;their points
being driven upwards, that wet may not be let
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
into the roof by them. The short diagonal runners
seen in the illustration crossing each other
between the horizontal lines are used in ornamental
thatching only, and are rather for appearance
than for use. Lastly, the eaves are cut to
shape, and trimmed with paring-knife and shears.</p>

<p>The roof looks most pretty and cosy within if
lined with ling. The ling is fixed in a way somewhat
akin to thatching. A layer is placed along
the bottom opposite to the eaves, and secured by a
strip of wood nailed from rafter to rafter; the
layer next above hides this strip, and so the work
is carried on to the apex, where a knot cut from
an apple-tree trunk, a bunch of fir-cones fastened
together, or some such matter, finishes the whole.
In districts where ling is not to be had, gorse
or furze in short pieces may serve instead, but
stout gloves are required to handle it; or the ends
of fir branches may do, if nothing better offers.</p>

<p>It is not always easy to decide on the best
way of forming a floor. Boards may look out of
place. A pitching of pebbles is more in character:
it is dry and cleanly, and especially if some
variety of colour is obtainable, and the stones are
arranged in some geometrical design, it may add
to the ornamental effect. Pebbles are not, however,
pleasing to the feet of those who wear thin
shoes. Gravel, where it is always dry, is apt to
become dusty, and to disagree with ladies' dresses.
If, however, gravel should be used, perhaps the
best plan to prevent the rising of damp, and to
obviate dust as far as possible, is to asphalt it:
on the foundation of broken stones and a layer
of coarse gravel to put a course of asphalt or of
ordinary gas tar, and on this to sift enough fine
<i>washed</i> gravel to hide it. Yet a wood pavement
of small larch poles, cut into 5-or 6-in. billets,
and pitched with some attention to geometrical
arrangement, will make the most dry and comfortable
of floors, and one which will not harmonise
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
badly with any of the decorative work of our
summer-house.</p>

<p>The octagonal house illustrated by Fig. 182 is
made up of varnished rustic work. The saplings
and twigs should be as straight and as regular
as possible, and divested of their bark.</p>

<p>The eight posts are 4 in. in diameter by
6 ft. 8 in. long. The short sill pieces are also
4 in. in diameter, while the middle rails are 3&frac12; in.
in diameter, and the plate is 3 in. by 4&frac12; in. The
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
floor and roof are constructed from ordinary
scantlings.</p>

<p>The posts form a circle 6 ft. 6 in. in diameter.
They are spaced about 2 ft. 3 in. apart, except
the door-posts, which are 2 ft. 7 in. centres.
Flats may be worked on the posts for the better
fitting of the door, panels, and casements, and the
top edge of the sill is also planed flat to receive
the floorboards, and a rebate is formed for the
<sup><span style="font-size:.7em">5</span></sup>/<span style="font-size:.7em">8</span>-in. matchboard (see <a href="#Fig_183">Fig. 183</a>).</p>

<p>The sill and middle rails are scribed and stub-tenoned
to the posts. The plate is halved,
dowelled, and nailed to the posts. The joists are
2 in. by 4 in., and are notched to the sills (<a href="#Fig_184">Fig. 184</a>)
and covered with 1-in. floorboards.</p>

<p>The roof is formed with three gables, four being
deemed unnecessary, as a summer-house is
generally fixed with its back to a shrubbery.
Eight hip rafters are required, and by fixing the
heels of each pair of rafters on the sides of the
plate marked 1, 2, 3, and 4 (see <a href="#Fig_185">Fig. 185</a>) more
space is acquired for the gables. The ridges and
valley-pieces of the gables are attached to a wide
batten screwed to the under side of the hip rafters
(see <a href="#Fig_185">Figs. 185</a> and <a href="#Fig_186">186</a>). Some of the small battens
are omitted from <a href="#Fig_185">Fig. 185</a> to give a better view
of the gables, etc.</p>

<p>The roof-covering is generally wheat straw,
with a top dressing of either broom or heather.
The dark colour of the two latter materials harmonises
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
much better with a varnished house than
does a covering wholly of straw. The four lower
panels are filled in with matchboarding, which is
carried right up to the plate in the three back
divisions. The rustic work, excepting the back
panels, is then fitted and nailed.</p>

<p>There are four casement windows, which open
outward. A section of casement and frame enlarged
is shown in <a href="#Fig_187">Fig. 187</a>. A shallow rebate

<p>The door (<a href="#Fig_188">Figs. 188</a> and <a href="#Fig_189">189</a>) is 6 ft. 1 in. by
2 ft. 3 in. The rustic work is overlaid on the

panel is filled with cork. The top panel
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>

rim lock are fitted on the inside of the door, and

<p>A seat 13 in. wide, supported on wide battens,
which in turn rest on shaped brackets, is fixed
at each angle. A sloping back (see <a href="#Fig_183">Fig. 183</a>) is
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
fitted, which adds to the general comfort. The
decoration of the inside should now receive attention.
The floor may be covered with linoleum,
the seats carpeted or cushioned. The sloping
backs of the seats and the walls will look well if
covered with Indian matting or Japanese leather
paper. Split cane or bamboo may be used with
good effect at the joints or angles. The under
side of the roof or ceiling should be first covered
by stretching canvas across the rafters, and to this
is attached the decorative material.</p>

<p>The summer-house stands on stone slabs raised
about 1 in. above the ground. The lower ends
of the posts are dressed with pitch, or are stood
on sheet lead. The triangular spaces in the gables
can be made to open inwards if desired, and used
for ventilation.</p>
